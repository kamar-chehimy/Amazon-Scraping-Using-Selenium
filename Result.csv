It was my first time using this tent. It was super windy and was raining buckets to the point where there were inches of standing water outside the tent (see photo). Without even treating it with campdry or any sealant, we were bone dry and cozy in this tent for five days, and we only had the rain fly on and a tarp that covered about half the tent. It is a freaking TANK! Been camping my whole life and never had a tent this waterproof. It's also super breathable even with the rain fly and a tarp; the little vent near the bottom is a great feature. Do yourself a favor and get this tent and a big tarp to go over it, and maybe a drop cloth to protect the bottom, and I promise you'll be dry in any storm. Plus, bonus points for being super easy to set up, and tall enough to stand in! Can't wait to use this tent again, it's better than any of the more expensive tents I've ever used.\n\nTip for getting it back in the bag:\nFold in half longways. Then fold in thirds longways. Then roll :) rain fly just folded a few times and rolled and had no problems getting it all back in the bag.\n\nEDIT: 4 years and many festivals, camping trips and a few girlfriends later, this tent is still going strong. You won’t be disappointed!"", 'My tent just arrived yesterday. I struggled on what to give this tent for a rating because I just got it. I was thinking about giving it a 3 for average which seemed fair to start with. But after seeing how it handled the wind without breaking or tearing, I decided to give it a 4 because it surpassed my expectations. I plan on using this tent quite a bit this summer so I will update my rating and review as I go. I found the assembly instructions to be very basic but adequate. Anyone who has put up a tent like this before will have no problem. It took me about 15 minutes. Anyway, I set my tent up in my back yard yesterday to see how it looked and how it took on the elements. My first test was wind. I have a weather station and the average wind speed was 7 to 8 mph with gusts up to 17 mph. The back of the tent was torward the wind and when the gusts would come, the back of the tent would bow it quite a bit. I have read the reviews some people have written and see some have had problems with the poles breaking. This is what I was afraid of as I watched the back of the tent bow in. I wish I had taken a picture because it was substantial. Anyway, the poles did not break and the tent returned to it’s original form when the gust passed every time. I have seen the video on Amazon of the testing process Coleman puts their tents through. Not sure how much wind this tent is rated for but I’m pretty sure 17 mph is close to it’s max. The tent looks to be made very well for the price I paid for it. There are only two guidelines that come off the rain fly on the sides of the tent. The tent is staked down on all four corners of the floor plus a floor vent in the back of the tent. In all, there are only 7 stake down points that I could see. I feel if the tent had some guidelines higher up on each of the four corners of the main body of the tent it could withstand more wind. The stakes are ok but bend fairly easily if the ground is too hard or you hit a rock when pounding them in. I will be buying some better ones before I go camping. I left the tent up over night and checked on it this morning. It held up very well and only one of the stakes for the rain fly guidelines had twisted in the ground causing the guideline to come loose. I left the tent up because it was going to rain today. I need to know if I have any leaks before I take it out camping. It has been raining lightly for two hours now and my weather station says I’m getting .05 inches of rain an hour with a light steady wind of 2 to 3 mph. Far from what I would consider a hard rain but it’s still rain. I went out and looked at just the outside and the water seems to be beading up and running off the rain fly and tent very well. It is supposed to rain until 9 or 10 o’clock tonight so I will check for water on the inside in the morning. I’m hoping not to see any with such a light rain. If there is, I will definitely be spraying the tent down with a waterproofing spray before I take it out camping. Now for the pro’s and con’s.\nPro’s:\n1). Great tent for the price. If your on a fixed budget or are looking for a good starter tent you will not beat this one.\n2). Very roomy inside. I plan on using this for two people, a shepherd and, all our gear.\n3) There is an eyelet at the top of the tent so you can attach a lantern and two side pockets for stowing smaller needed items like a headlamp, cell phone, keys and, so on.\n4). There is a small zipper in the bottom front left side of the tent for running wires. See my picture. It is covered by a little yellow strip of material to protect the zipper from the rain. You do not see this feature on most tents. I plan on using it with my solar panel so I can charge my power core, headlamp, cell phone and, other gear from inside the tent out of direct sunlight.\n5). I was surprised at how much give the tent had at 17 mph gusts and did not break any poles or tear. It bounced right back to it’s original form.\nCon’s:\n1). You may want to consider buying stronger tent stakes.\n2). I wish there was a high point on each of the four corners for attaching extra guidelines. Although it handled 17 mph gusts very well the tent did bow in quite a bit. If I had to guess, the tent was reduce by almost half it’s size. If I was inside the tent I know I would have been annoyed being hit by it every time a gust came. I really don’t feel the tent as is, could handle much more then that. I’m thinking about how to attach extra guidelines in the corners without effecting the structural stability and elasticity of the tent. Make sure you pitch this tent in a sheltered area out of the wind if your expecting bad weather.\n\nUpdate 04/30/18\nI went out the next morning after the light rain and the inside was dry. The following day saw more rain showers with substantially more rain. Checked the tent again today and it is still dry. After reading some of the reviews I really thought this tent would leak. Because this tent has preformed better then expected I have changed my rating to a five. I am going to seal the seams and spray waterproofing on the tent anyway because I would rather be safe then sorry. For the size and price of this tent you will not find a better deal. Just remember to pitch your tent in a sheltered area in you are expecting winds and you will not be disappointed. I think I have figured out a way to put up extra guidelines on each of the four corners so the tent will preform better with heavy gusts of wind. I will test it out and take pictures. More to come.\n\nThat is all for now and there will be more updates coming.', 'While the tent is well made and easy to assemble, it more realistically holds about 4 people at max. The most disappointing thing was that it clearly says this comes with 6 horses (see the attached picture). I only received the tent, no ponies.', 'Great tent. I set it up in my backyard, to give it a trial run (and seam seal) before taking it out camping. There are pros and cons...\n\nPros:\nCarry bag - the tent comes neatly packed in a carry bag, with tent, poles, rain fly, ground stakes, door mat, and instructions.\nSetup - Easy. Set up by myself, with rain fly, in under 15 minutes. Didn\'t have to look at the directions. Only suggestion would be to put the word ""front"" somewhere on the rain fly to indicate which way it goes. However, a quick glance at the packaging will tell you.\nMaterials - the tent material seems to be of good quality, and should hold up well when taken care of. The zippers are not heavy duty, but i see no issues with them. The floor is heavy duty tarp material.\nScreens - the tent has large screen panels on the ""ceiling"", which makes for a great view when the rain fly is not on. There is an additional window, and screen on the door for extra viewing and airflow.\nFloor Vent - there is a vent near the rear of the tent, which allows for additional airflow.\nCord access - there is a small zippered panel in the front corner, that let\'s you run an extension cord into the tent.\n\nOther ""Pros"":\nI got the Navy/Grey tent, and the colors are cool. Got some compliments from the neighbors on it. I like that the rain fly comes with the guy lines already attached. The interior gear pockets are fine, good for holding your phone. Wouldn\'t stuff them with anything heavy. There is a little ""ring"" at the center of the ceiling, to hang a small light. While you could technically fit 2 queen air mattresses, I would not. It leaves no floor space for gear. I will put in one mattress, and leave the other half of the tent for my kids Pack n\' Play, and gear. It will fit the 3 of us comfortably. However, unless you intend to get cozy, I wouldn\'t advise this for 4 adults (but it could be done).\n\nCons:\nStakes - the stakes are just ok...they are the generic skinny steel ones. I would recommend spending an extra $10 bucks and buy some good ones.\nFootprint - the tent doesn\'t come with a footprint, though I imagine this helps keep the cost so low. Not a big deal, I use a tarp anyways.\nDoor Screen - the upper half of the door can be unzipped to reveal the screen window. I really would have liked if the entire door could be screen, not just the top half.\n\nI also purchased some Coleman Seam Sealer, and sealed all the seams inside the tent, and the rain fly. Some of the seams are taped, but it\'s just good practice to spend the time to do this, no matter what brand/cost/etc tent you have. It saves headache down the road.\n\nOverall, I\'m very pleased with the tent, and the cost. It will work well for short camping trips with a small family, couple, or individual.', ""Our first tent was an enormous Montana 8 person tent that used 6 poles and took 45 minutes to set up properly. Our second tent was an instant double hub dome tent that had permanent poles that kept flipping upside down making it impossible to set up. (We returned that one.) This tent, however, is no-nonsense. Two poles to put the tent up. One extra pole to hold the rainfly up. We put the tent up in a Florida thunderstorm in less than 5 minutes. We took another 5 minutes to set the 7 guy lines. I didn't get the opportunity to spray and seam seal the tent since it was raining, but it did not leak through some very powerful Florida rainstorms, except for a few drops around the electrical port zipper. Seal that part especially. The tent moved around and shook through some rough ocean wind, but remained intact. The tent is tall enough to stand up in (6ft tall) with room for a queen sized air mattress and tons of space for your stuff. We had a cooler, a big box fan, and two pieces of luggage in there with room to spare. I would say it's perfect for 2 people, comfortable with 3, claustrophobic with 4, and you'd have to be desperate to fit 5 or 6. There is a port for your electrical cord. Two pockets are attached inside, and a welcome mat was included.\n\nTaking the tent down was just as simple. Just fold in half twice, then fold into thirds and roll up. It fit right into the bag with no problems. Easiest tent I've ever dealt with!\n\nI'd recommend a 10x10 tarp to go under the tent and a 10x20 tarp to go over it. There are two huge mesh panels on the top of the tent, which is great for ventilation, but bad for sideways rain that can sneak under the rainfly. I put the tarp longways over these vents and it kept out the sideways rain but there was still plenty of ventilation.\n\nThere is a hook at the top to attach an LED light/fan.\n\nIt was fantastic for warm/hot weather camping. Might be too much ventilation for late fall camping, though, unless I can figure out a way of blocking those mesh panels.\n\nBest tent I've ever owned!"", ""To start, this is a fantastic tent to take the family out for the weekend during warm weather. It is spacious, has plenty of headroom, has an awesome full tarp liner for the bottom (I still recommend placing another ground tarp down before setting up the tent to avoid any rips or tears in the tents bottom, let the cheaper replaceable ground tarp take that beating) If you are going for a multi day float trip this tent couldn't be better, or if you are camping where your car is accessible and weight is not so much of an issue this tent is AWESOME. And as far as my comment about the weight, its a 3 person tent, so I cant really complain that much (I acknowledge my bias, I prefer 2lb 1man tents, thought not nearly as spacious or user friendly).\n\nI got this tent because I knew I wanted more room for the dog and to get my girlfriend to actually enjoy camping. But I didn't expect this tent to be this huge, we had more than enough room for the two of us and my dog (lab/pointer mix) with plenty of room for our packs.\n\nThis tent WILL KEEP YOU DRY, I took this tent on a multi day float trip from Missouri down into Arkansas, during which time I got rained on and the river even came up to one corner of the tent bottom and not a drop came into the tent.\n\nIf you are an average camper who isn't so much into the long distance backpacking this tent is awesome, seriously, you should just buy it now if you fit in that category.\n\nNow here are my critiques, and my comments for those more adventurous people looking for a tent.\n\nThis is NOT a COLD WEATHER tent! This is also the reason I didn't give it the full 5 stars. I took this tent out for a trip to the spanish peaks in colorado and camped out multiple nights. It was mid May and we camped at 10K ft. the night dropped down to the low 20's F and we were freezing, the gusts of wind would run right through this tent. This tent has a big mesh ceiling, a tall ceiling, and a large breathable mesh hole on the back wall, all of this is great for warm environments, however, it does not hold in heat, it expels it. It is too breathable for cold or windy environments.\n\nFor those looking for a winter tent, I am not saying that you want a tent that is totally sealed up, tents that are totally sealed up cause you to sweat and holds in the moisture, moisture is your enemy in below freezing condition. You want something breathable, but you also want to keep in the heat, look for something with a lower ceiling and a rain fly that runs all the way to the ground, including covering up the doors (people use that area for their boots usually). Tents that have those types of rain fly's will have slots cut out that you can open to get a small amount of breathability out of the rain fly. With the addition of a rain fly like that I would say that this tent would fully fall into that 3rd season they advertise, but without a beefed up rain fly I would argue that this tent is more compatible for summer camping only. This rain fly keeps out the rain exceptionally well, but not so much the wind. I would also advise any backpackers, to take a wool blanket to set as a floor mat, then lay your sleeping pads on that, you will be much warmer and happier."", 'I purchased this tent as a last minute replacement when I discovered all our previous tents had problems that were not things I could immediate fix. So since I\'ve only used this for a weekend camping trip so far, and in ideal weather, I can\'t answer a lot but here are my opinions on it:\n\n- How many can fit?\n6 KIDS could probably fit. If you\'re an experienced camper then you obviously already knew this wouldn\'t fit 6 adults (or even teens) but I just feel the need to specify this. Realistically though if you\'re using camping mats that aren\'t larger than a sleeping and are adults you could squeeze 4 with room for bags at your feet. Cot wise I was using a Tenton Sports Adventurer so with using that as a reference I would say you could squeeze a maximum of 3 in there with no real aisle space on either side (maybe a leg width?), this is assuming you use the end point to enter and leave as well as storing underneath the cots. If you want more elbow room then I wouldn\'t put more than 2 in of that size, you could definitely put 2 of the XXL version of Tenton\'s cot as well and have space for an aisle between in which case with larger cots you could probably fit 2 couples comfortably if there aren\'t a million bags to deal with.\n- Is set up easy?\nAs someone who has grown up camping this is pretty much your standard tent design in terms of set up. I ended up at the campsite well after dark and had a veteran camper along with a friend who doesn\'t tent camp often for helping me set it up to which it took us less than 5 minutes to put up. Super easy and does not require instructions if you\'ve ever put up a tent like it before.\n- How is break down?\nLast day of the camp out I ended up having to break down the tent alone so it took me maybe more like 10 minutes but with help it shouldn\'t take that long at all. I even managed to get it into the bag WITH SPACE TO SPARE.... I folded in half then into 3rds and it fit without any struggle with everything rolled up in the tent. Still shocked it fit that easily after years of struggling with other tents to fit back into their bags.\n- Is there headroom to stand?\nYes, PLENTY of head room and probably the roomiest tent I have owned to date. I\'m 5\'5"" and even with a small hanging light I got for the top of the tent I still had an arms reach above worth of room. Closer to the walls obviously it\'s a bit shorter but I did not feel the slightest bit restricted like a normal small tent has.\n- Is it warm?\nOn a sunny day with it entirely closed it got a tad warm when I checked in on it but with all the ventilation it has built in already it really doesn\'t get scorching like some tents do if you don\'t have any windows open. The first night with this tent it actually got pretty chilly and the tent was assuredly not meant for colder nights, with a better sleeping bag rated for colder weather you should be fine though... mine just was very old and not great against the cold anymore.\n- Does it hold up to rain?\nI camped in sunny weather, so I cannot personally review it from experience, but I would say this is not a tent that I would knowingly take on a camping trip that will have rain. The only real reason I say this is because the back has this little vent to let air in around head level if you\'re sleeping on the ground which is great for summer/warm weather but as someone that has been in a flooded tent before it just seems like a horrible feature if you\'re going up against a storm. Some reviews claimed this wasn\'t a problem though so perhaps it isn\'t as big of an issue as it just appears to be from my perspective at least.\n\nOverall I love this tent, wish it retained heat a bit more, but definitely look forward to using it again on the next camping trip! Feel free to ask any further questions I\'ll try my best to keep on top of replies.', 'Good gosh folks! I bought this 2-man tent due to the low price and the high scoring reviews here at Amazon and the reviews are spot on. I had my eye on quite a few other tents at $125 to $250 but I have to say this one caught my eye early on because of the reviews. I said: ""wtf? Order it and see how it performs and if it was all a big lie then I\'m out a measly $38!""\n\nNOTE: On the advice of lots of folks here I purchased a small 2 oz bottle of ""Coleman Seam Sealer"" (available here or at Wal-Mart). The day the tent arrived I set it up outside on my back deck and sealed all the seams and let it dry for about 4 hours before folding it back up and putting it away.\n\nPROS: This tent is inexpensive, light weight, easy to erect, and does it\'s job quite well. It assembles in about 3 to 5 minutes (if you\'ve done it once or twice). The instructions are a perfect guide if you cannot remember the 3 easy steps.\n\nCAMPING IN THE RAIN: So I went on my first camping trip with it this past weekend and I was caught in an off-and-on torrential downpour from 10 PM at night through 9 AM the next morning and guess what? I stayed completely dry and slept very well. I did forget to zip the small electrical cord opening shut for the first few hours and the sideways rain got a few drops in there until I realized it and zipped it tight. I left the vent windows open during the entire storm and had zero issues with water.\n\nTIP: Be sure to bring a couple of large black trash bags to put the tent into if you have to break camp while it is still raining. That prevented a huge wet mess inside the car when I departed the camp site.\n\nTime will tell if this is a durable product ... but so far so good. LIKE!', "" This Coleman 4 person tent kept us warm and dry on our camping trip this Memorial Day weekend. This was my very first time setting up a tent and camping out with 2 kids and 2 dogs in tow, and it took me just 15 minutes to set up the tent.\n\nSet up took 15 minutes from start to finish for a tent newbie like me with some help from one kid. Based on forum advice I got some tent pegs that were easy to drive into the ground so I did not use the ones that come with the tent, so I had a very easy time setting it up. The poles were already connected by a string and I had to thread them through and clip them on with the attached clips. I also got a heavy duty tarp for the bottom of the tent based on advice on some reviews posted here. I had to fold it slightly to make sure it stayed under the tent. then once the tent was all straightened out I drove in the pegs into the ground. The rain fly was easy to install too and the included cords helps make sure the rain fly is stretched out away from the vents.\n\nThe 4 person tent is 9ft by 7ft and it fitted an Intex Queen Mattress that I inflated in 15 min with a handpump. There was a little room on all sides of the tent after fitting in the mattress. If you push it to one side then there was place for one small person. We had 1 adult and 2 teenagers in the tent and our 75 lb lab and we were pretty comfortable with room to turn while sleeping. There was not really room for more than one small duffel bag after packing in 3 people and a dog, so if you're using this as a backpacking tent and plan to store your gear you can only fit in 2 people. I was glad that I had got this size compared to the 3 person tent (7ft X 7 ft) as it would have only fitted in a queen mattress and no more, and we ended up needing more room. I think the 4 person is a great size for 2 people to sleep in comfortably and have a bit more room to bring in a kid if needed.\n\nI had carried a seam sealer but reviews advised not to use it as the tent remains dry. There was no rain that night, just a little moisture in the air. The tent is very well ventilated so it got cold and airy in the tent in the night. Next time I may carry something to cover the vent on one side or maybe a warmer sleeping bag as the night got colder than we had anticipated. This would be a great tent for warmer summer evenings.\n\nThe white walls of the tent reflect light well and there are 2 pockets on the side where you can put a flashlight facing upward to illuminate the whole tent. Another feature I liked was that the bottom of the tent comes up all around about 4 inches which helps keep dirt and water out. It's also advisable to pitch the tent on higher ground slightly sloping downwards so that the water flows downward away from you.\n\nThe pull down was just as easy as the put up. It was easy to bring down and fold up the poles. However, I could not fit it back inside the bag. How did they manage to fit it inside that tiny bag in the first place is a mystery. I put the pegs, poles and my extra tarp inside and will find another bag for the tent itself.\n\nNow that I've learned that's it's not too hard to set up a tent, I plan to go camping more often with this Coleman Sundome tent.\n\nUpdate 7/9/2015 -\nThe 4 person tent held up well and has been put up and taken down about 5-6 times already. It takes just 15 minutes to set up and is very comfortable in 45 degrees plus weather with a warm sleeping bag. For colder temperatures, I wouldn't recommend this tent. It's very airy and the 2 side windows that zip down made it comfortable even in 70 degree weather. For even warmer days you can leave the rain fly off if there is no chance of rain. I figured out finally how to roll it back tightly so it fits back inside the bag with all accessories. You just need to make sure you have the door and window unzipped so you can let all the air out and then it rolls up tight.\n\nI also purchased the Coleman 3 person tent, it is about 7 ft by 7 ft inside and just about fits an Intex Queen size air mattress. On a recent camping trip the 3 person tent worked for 2 teenagers and a dog inside the tent. It is a compact tent for 2 people, you can fit in 2 adults but there won't be any room for bags. It's not the lightest tent I've seen, but it's fairly small and fits back easily into the bag it comes in. We set up this one about 4 times and took it down in different camping grounds. The pegs did not hold up well in hard ground but I'd purchased a set of better pegs from Amazon.\n\nI am really pleased with both the tents and will be using them for many more camping trips.\n\nUpdate 9/29/16 - This tent is still going strong, I had my daughter put it up by herself and took a time lapse video. With a little help, it's even easier to put up, but she wanted to demonstrate putting it up with no help. It took her about 20 minutes, if there is someone to hold and align the poles it takes less time. It rained for hours in the night and the next day on our last day - this was a trip to Glacier National Park. We were both warm and dry in our 4 person and 3 person tent and it was kind of fun to hear the rain beat hard against the tent. I had not applied any seam glue to either of the tents, but might do so in the future. Unfortunately, on a subsequent trip in late fall, the tent pole snapped as the person setting it up with my daughter did not have much experience and went too hard. I now have to figure out how to get a replacement pole."", "" Great 2-person tent. We needed a tent for our 8 year old son and found this at a great price on Amazon. It's very easy to put up, take down and is very light weight. Only takes minutes. The material is strong, poles are solid and it has two small pockets on the inside, and it fits a twin-size air mattress easily inside. We had our son pitch this tent in the yard just before a thunderstorm to test how it would hold up in heavy wind and rain. My husband (6 ft) and son weathered the storm in the tent pitched in our yard and as you can see on the video, the tent is solid and didn't budge. They were completely dry inside with the heavy winds up to 50mph and rain. We left it up in our yard for a week. It also gets great airflow. The only complaint the boys had was that when it gets really windy, the top rain cover design creates a loud howling noise when the wind gets between it and the main tent. Other than that, this is a truly solid tent, great purchase, and we highly recommend it. Our dog also loves the tent.""]","[[['POSITIVE', 0.9941220879554749]], ['The text is too big to be classified'], [['NEGATIVE', 0.9978148937225342]], ['The text is too big to be classified'], [['POSITIVE', 0.8889446258544922]], ['The text is too big to be classified'], ['The text is too big to be classified'], [['POSITIVE', 0.7254887819290161]], ['The text is too big to be classified'], [['POSITIVE', 0.9988652467727661]]]"

I set the tent up in the back yard to make sure everything worked, it started to rain and almost instantly I noticed the seams of the tent were leaking water. I’m am really disappointed as this tent is supposedly rated high for being water proof. The more frustrating part was I had to speak to 4 different Amazon representatives to coordinate an exchange, they were finally able to accommodate me and get a new tent sent. We will see in a few days if the new tent is also defective. Coleman is usually a quality brand and this product had really high rating but I am very disappointed thus far.', ""So we were a little hesitant on making this purchase after reading the 3 star and below reviews. However, some close friends and camping partner family own this tent. Here is what we did:\n\nStep 1- Order the tent\nStep 2- Order TENT SEAM SEALER\nStep 3- Order Rain Fly (no brainer people)\nStep 4- When tent arrives excitedly open box, and set up in the living room (optional, and be sure to check with your spouse first as this did not go over well with mine)\nStep 5- Take down tent from living room and set up again outside....Use the seam sealer around ALL seams inside and outside the tent liberally (or follow directions on sealant product)\nStep 6- Put rainfly on tent\nStep 7- Connect garden hose and prepare leaf blower for weather simulation testing.\nStep 8- After waiting desired time for sealant to set, simulate various types of rain storms from gentle drizzle to driving hurricane force rain (do this at your own risk and be sure to roll up windows on your spouses car when aiming simulated rain in that direction)\nStep 9- Now using your leaf blower blast your tent with simulated wind levels from gentle meadow breezes to Hurricane Level 4 winds if you have a 4 speed leaf combo snow blower (again, do this at your own risk)\nStep 10- Stake down your tent THEN redo step 9, then apologize to your spouse for crushing her flowers.\n\nDuring all the simulated test I found that the tent is NOT made for 50+ psi garden house spray down at full forces.... However, there was minimal leaking, and I think that was from spraying right at the zipper. When using in a true rain fashion there was no leaking after a 10 minute soaking. The blower was a little over the top, but even after rolling my unstaked tent into my wifes flowers the tent took all I threw at it. I was going to repeat all the test and make a video to attach with this review but was advised (told) by my wife that I wasn't going to do that....Argh!\n\nThanks Coleman for a great tent! Set it up in less than 30 seconds and take down was just as simple, and I had a blast with my homemade weather simulation testing."", 'I have a standard 4 person Coleman dome tent. I purchased this tent because I take many camping trips alone and my other tent can be a bit of a pain to put up by myself. Had it out this last weekend to give it a try. As advertised it was very quick to set up. Took a little more then 60 seconds just because I had never set it up before. Being a cabin style tent it does have good stand room in the center. I stand 6\' 1"". There are some thing s about this tent I will have to get use to. The door, unlike my other tent, is not centered. It is off to the right. My wife went with me and this caused a little stumbling over each other trying to get out. The door has two zippers which were a little difficult to get open in the dark, early in the morning. IT has two windows up front, two large windows on the sides but, no window in the back. With only one little vent in the top ventilation was questionable. The window flaps could be rolled but they could not be tie and secured out of the way. Over all a nice tent.\nTook it for the first time on my own. Again was easy to set up. This trip it did rain. Rain fly is useless. Unless you have the windows zipped all the way up, you are going to get wet. Then windows up, no ventilation. Got hot inside real fast. Door is a real pain at night in the dark to get in and out of. Don\'t be in a hurry.', ' I wanted a tent that I could easily set up by myself for solo camping trips. And this tent has exceeded all of my expectations!! I’ve used it several times this summer and it has done wonderfully in all climates. I took it to Zion where I pulled it out of this box and set it up for the first time on the video, I’ve taken it to the desert in Nevada and somehow it stayed clean, and it’s been through a summer downpour with extreme winds and I stayed dry and the tent didn’t budge with the wind. Very water resistant and weatherproof! This is one of my all time favorite purchases and the best part is I can get it back into the bag all on my own. Which makes camping much easier.', ""Disappointing. I've been an avid supporter of Coleman products for many years due to the affordability and quality of their products. I've owned a 4-person dome tent for nearly 15 years that has never leaked, never blown over, never given me trouble. Me and my wife just got a little older and decided we needed something we could stand up in and use a cot in. So we bought this. The design engineer missed the boat on this and so did quality control. I've tried different methods to try to get the tent to be taut and tight on all four slopes, but I just can't do it. It needs at least one more connection to the corner support poles on each corner because it bags and sags three quarters of the way up the corner. This causes a sag on the interior that reduces space and helps worsen the leaking. It has a loop for a stake midway between the corners in the front and back but not on the sides. It needs one because you can't keep the floor taut without them.\nLeaking, Leaking and more leaking. Amazing that this didn't come with a rain fly. No, not amazing, ridiculous. Where didn't it leak? This was not a hurricane - just some simple showers. It leaked at every corner floor joint. Every window leaked even when zippered completely shut. The door leaked. Who designed the door zipper? Fire that person. The zipper on my dome tent is perfect - why did someone think that needed to be changed? The windows all leaked along the bottom seam. Why? Because the side slopes can't be made taut, it rains down, water runs down the sides and collects at the bottom of the window. It has no place to go but in the tent - it's as if someone designed it that way!! The only way to prevent that leakage is to install a second shelter - or tarp - over the tent with sides, back and front that extend beyond the bottom of the window. I looked at the rain fly you can buy for this tent, and I don't think it does that. The leaking seam at the corners and where the floor connects just seems to be poor quality workmanship. I gave it a second and third coat of seam sealer and it did reduce the amount of leaking, but didn't eliminate it. I brought the tent home, set it up and let it dry out real good, then gave it a fourth really heavy dose of seam sealer at all seams. We'll see if that helps. I also designed my own rain tarp out of an old shelter frame I had that I will put over the tent next time. That's ridiculous to have to put up a shelter to put my tent under. Ridiculous. Why am I even giving this a three???? I guess because I can stand up in it, it goes up quickly, and it fits my queen-size cot with room to spare.\nUpdate:\nI've decided to get a new tent. Not a Coleman. The engineering and quality of this tent was just horrible. I've coated the tent inside and out with at least 4 applications of silicone spray and several coats of seam sealer on all seams. I even caulked the floor to wall seam with clear silicone caulk. I noticed in the pictures that there are 5 pole to tent clips on each corner. Mine only had 4, so I added tarp clips on the corners where it was sagging. The walls sagged so I added tarp clips on the sides to tighten the walls and floor. See pictures. I bought the rain fly. It rained tonight and the interior is soaked. Water leaked right through the walls and especially at the base of the windows. I'm leaving next Sunday for a week camping in the UP of Michigan. I hope my new tent gets here in time. Really, I recommend you do not by this tent!"", 'Very happy with this tent so far. I haven’t been able to set it up and use it in rainy weather yet, so I’ll have to report back later on weatherproofing.\n\nThis tent set up just as quickly and easily as my previous instant tent did. It takes a little getting used to the “solid/hinged door”, as it relies on a pole system on the outer rim that zips up in the door. Once figured out, all was good, but it sucks having a second zipper running along the outer edge of the door, as this can get confusing as myself and one other person already mistook it during first use as a regular zipper to open the door.\n\nPRO: because of the dark nature of this tent, it seems to be a thicker material and did a good job cutting down wind on a breezy and chilly night. Something not advertised in the ability of this tent.\n\nTo say that it cut down on the amount of light coming in would be an understatement. There’s nearly no light let in and most of it that does come in comes through a zipper or two that you haven’t fully met up on the doors or windows.\n\nI will keep this updated once I get a full season out of this tent! Hopefully!', 'I cannot recommend this 4 person cabin more. Its not to be used backpacking only out of vehicle camping. My gf and I set this up in no time. Make sure to purchase the rain fly and tent kit for the mallet and upgraded steaks. Held up to a thunderstorm all weekend in grand canyon the very first time we used it. Fit a queen bed with about 2.5 feet of free space left on the entrance door side. I even put big coals in my solo stove and and the tent was 70+ while it was around 30 outside at night. Ventilation was great even in the rain with the fly. highly recommended for expedition vehicles i will surely have this for years.']","[[['POSITIVE', 0.5570009350776672]], [['POSITIVE', 0.874724805355072]], [['NEGATIVE', 0.9975080490112305]], [['NEGATIVE', 0.9983952641487122]], [['NEGATIVE', 0.9967082738876343]], [['NEGATIVE', 0.9970929622650146]], [['POSITIVE', 0.9968400001525879]], ['The text is too big to be classified'], [['NEGATIVE', 0.9737574458122253]], [['POSITIVE', 0.9829713702201843]]]"

In the description for the tent, Coleman states, ""If it rains, the included rainfly and the WeatherTec™ system with its patented welded floors and inverted seams will help you stay dry."" Unfortunately, it rained and the tent leaked through the floor and the sides. When they returned home from the trip my husband told me about his new tent leaking. I suggested he get in touch with Coleman and speak with customer service. Customer service stated that the tent was not waterproof and would leak. When he referred back to the ""WeatherTec system that will help you stay dry"" they again stated it is not waterproof.\n\nAt that point, my husband decided to write a review about the tent to express his disappointment with not only the tent but also with Customer Service. He wrote on Coleman\'s website "" This tent leaks. On the first use this tent leaked. I contacted customer service and they were not willing to even discuss it. Their words are ""they are not guaranteed to not leak. They are only water resistant."" It seems very dishonest.""\n\nHe received a response back from Coleman this evening which said, ""Our staff has read your review and values your contribution even though it did not meet all our website guidelines. Thanks for sharing, and we hope to publish next time!"" Buyer be aware, if you don\'t find ratings lower than 4 stars it might be because they won\'t publish them.\n\nSo, word to the wise, unless you like rain on your parade, pick a different tent! Better yet, pick a company that will stand behind their product and their customers.', "" Buy this tent only if you are an amphibian or have a strong affinity towards water because if it rains you will get wet. Not just a drip mind you, just your own personal swimming pool. Great if it's a hot afternoon or something it would cool you down. Not 45 degrees out and 2am. See attached video"", "" I can't complain. We stayed dry after one of the worst storms I've EVER been though (and not just camping, but in all my life).\n\nSet up was simple and quick. After just 2 hours of having the tent set up a horrible storm rolled through the camp site and immediately started raining and hailing out of no where. Hail ranged from pea sized to just larger than marble/nickle sized. The wind was a steady 35 mph with gusts up to 65 + mph. The storm lasted for 30 min and left just as it came. With all the rain came a river that passed right through where our tent was.\n\nAfter the storm we assessed the damage. The 2 side poles that expand both the wings came out of place, which lead to the rain fly having too much slack letting in minimal water through the mesh roof. However (not expecting a near tornado) we had only used 5 of the 7 tie downs on the rain fly. I feel like if we were to have used the 2 rear side tie downs we probably would have been safe from any moisture coming in. And with 3-4 in of water flowing briskly through our site I have to say I am quite pleased that NONE of the water came into our tent.\n\nOverall, really great tent....and the video testing weather conditions, very accurate!"", 'We\'ve had the Coleman Montana 8-person tent for a while, and for the cost, it\'s a pretty good tent. It\'s not the best tent, and there are some not-so-great points, and some ok points. I\'ve only had it in light rain, some cool camping, and some normal hot summer camping. Here are some positive (+), mixed (±), and negative (–) points about it:\n\n+ It\'s quite sturdy, very easy to put up, and a great occasional-camper tent that will be great for all around use.\n+ Really, it\'s easy to put up. I\'d say it takes 10 minutes to put up without the fly.\n+ It\'s tall. I\'m a tall guy (over 6 feet) and it have no problem standing or moving around in this tent.\n+ It\'s definitely roomy. We use a queen air mattress (the really high one) and a single for the kid. There is plenty of room for us to move around plus have all of our gear without tripping over it.\n+ With the fly off, during hot, dry camping it stays pretty cool, and lots of breeze passes through it. Plus, stars!\n± The fly is a bit tricky to put on, but it\'s ok once you get it on. Once you figure out how it goes on, you can get it on pretty quickly, like when it starts raining in the middle of the night.\n+ The ""tub"" style bottom is good for keeping out crap from the outside from getting in, including water.\n+ The door is a pretty nifty idea and works pretty well. The velcro is small patches and doesn\'t hold it shut very well, though, so you will want to zip it more often to keep bugs out. This is not a tremendous hassle.\n– Because of the raised door ""sill"" from the construction of the tub, expect to trip while going in and out of this tent *a lot.* It is the one thing that gets continuous curses from my family.\n+ It kept out the rain we encountered with no problem. Others have suggested you may want to seal the seams and coat it with silicone, but we haven\'t had to do that yet, since most of our camping has been during dry weather.\n– It comes with a teeny, tiny ""mat"" for the front door. Really, just throw this away or use it or something else. It\'s too tiny for the entrance. Use a good-sized, normal tarp, instead.\n± Inside it has two small pockets for things, at diagonal ends of the tent. I wish they were bigger and there were four of them.\n+ The ""port"" thing is actually quite handy if you need an electrical cord running into your tent.\n– The stakes that come with it are a joke. They are bent heavy wire about 6 inches long that pull out of the ground at the slightest breeze. Buy some real stakes to help out.\n– Without the fly, there are no points to attach any guylines. Contrary to what the manufacturer says, this tent will pretty much lay over when it encounters a good wind along the widest part. With no actual guyline points, it will not stay up straight. The fly has points for them, but if you don\'t want to use the fly, you\'re out of luck.\n+ When you are done, it comes down easily.\n– The storage bag is useless once you unpack the tent. Buy a decent sized, inexpensive duffel bag to store this in, including the better stakes, the regular-sized tarp, and the original bag that it comes with, rather than fight to get it to fit in the original bag. At the end of a camping trip, when you are tired, sunburned, and have packed the rest of your stuff, rolling this thing up to fit in the original bag is just incredibly pointless. The bag is a marketing trick (look how small it is!) and is machine packed, unused. Get a duffel bag, roll up the tent and pitch it in, done, 15 minutes max. You will thank me.', 'I bought this tent for my family of four. My wife and I used it for the first time this weekend for a tubing trip without the kids. The two of us set it up in about 10 minutes for the first time and we didn\'t even fight once! The instructions were written well. I did buy some 10"" metal tent stakes to replace the stakes that came with the tent based on other reviews. The temps were in the 90s and I was worried about ventilation because there are small windows in this tent, but the mesh roof seemed to allow adequate ventilation, and we slept fine with our battery operated fans. Our second night we had major thunderstorms. The tent performed exceptionally well under high winds and sideways rain! We did have to close the side windows, but we were able to keep the screen on the door open because the overhang on the rain fly kept rain out. We got 2.5"" of rain in a couple of hours and not a drop inside. I did lay a tarp under the tent and I had water between the tarp and the tent floor, but absolutely no water on the tent floor. We used a queen air mattress and it fit perfectly with room to spare on the sides. When we camp with the kids we will put another queen mattress on the other side and still have room for bags and gear in the center. I uploaded a pic of the tent without the rain fly because most stock photos on the web don\'t show the tent without the fly. I love this tent!', 'So..I am an avid camper. Been camping many times since I was a kid. I have owned 3 tents in 25 years of on my own camping, the Coleman Montana 8 is the 3rd. When I was looking for a tent, I did a lot of research, and read many reviews. I would say for the Montana 8, the reviews have been pretty accurate. It is very roomy, yet a bit narrow and although on our trip the weather was sort of ok...I can see ventilation being a problem on hotter, more humid days and nights. But overall it is a solid tent.\n\nFirst off, you have to know in shopping for a tent that a 4 person tent is good for two people and gear and 6 person is good for 3-4 people and 6-8 person tents are good for 4-5 adults and children if you want to be comfortable and not on top of each other. With that said, me, my son (5) and my friend and his son (4) had just about the perfect amount of room (maybe a tad more than we needed). Each little family had one side of the tent with a good amount of room in the middle for moving around and bags and such.\n\nHonestly, if there was anyone else in there it would have been a little crowded. So think about it, 2 adults and 2 kids and it was just about perfect. My son and I had the Coleman 4 in 1 bed with the mattress\' side by side...which they say is a about a king size mattress...it fit fine. My friend had a queen size sleeping mat on his side and it fit fine.\n\nSo while it was roomy for us, I wouldn\'t try to fit more than 5 people in there comfortably. If you are a family or set of friends of 3-4, this is a great size for you.\n\nThe set up - my son and I got to the site first and started with the tent. We had never taken the tent out of the box it was delivered in, so we went at it blind. If you have never set up a tent before I can see it being a bit overwhelming at first, but with more than one person, you should be able to get it. If you have set up a tent before, you will be fine with one person. I did it with my 5 year old and while he wasn\'t much help, I did need him to hold up the sides when it came time to make them tight. If he wasn\'t there I would have just stood them up and staked them to hold them up, so it really won\'t be a problem to do it by yourself...if you have done it before. I\'d say 30-45 mins set up for one experienced person to complete.\n\nAs I said, we took it out of the box at the site, so I added no extra rain seal or anything and sure enough it rained on us the two mornings we woke up there. Not a drop got in that I could see and the rain was substantial at times...the kids just played in the tent, plenty of room to pass a nerf football, and we waited out the rain in there....not a problem at all. Except, ventilation, we did have damp clothes and bedding, but it was not the rain, it was the lack of ventilation.\n\nWhich brings me to the only two down sides, there are two small windows on either end and the screen door, so there is no real cross breeze. I even had the tent turned so the windows were in the direction of the wind, the windows are too small. Bottom line, better ventilation is needed, maybe just a venting window on the back wall facing the door. I had a tent fan to sleep with (got that because of the reviews I had read)....I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT if you need air to sleep such as I :) In a little colder environment, this would be a very warm tent. The only other negative is the awning or the ""porch"" this is not a porch...I was up one night while everyone was asleep and it started to rain. I put my chair under the ""porch"" to watch the fire and the rain and there is hardly any protection at all to sit under there.\n\nThe door is awesome. With kids running in and out it\'s great...but you still have to zipper it each time and both kids handled the zipper door very well and the zipper handled them well.\n\nI would say overall I am very happy with this tent, just needs better ventilation. It\'s tall so you can stand up in it and that is important if you are getting older like me :) I am 6ft tall and fit fine in there. There may be better tents out there....but not many at this price. Happy Camping!', ""Good Tent. Used it 3 weeks ago. I slept 5. Me, my wife and my 3 boys during a cub scout campout. I had a Queen size air bed and a full size airbed on either end of the tent and still had what seemed like 6 feet of space in between, which I used to set up a 3'x3' roll table and store my gear. The door is very convenient. It can be tricky to get the velcro to lineup, but not a big deal at all. What I really like about the door is the design. I had zipper issues with a previous tent, because of the tension put on the door. This tent zips very easily, and I can see it lasting much longer!! I got a lot of compliments from the other dads too, which is always a plus ;)"", 'I\'m writing this review after two camping trips. In the first trip we were only 2 in the tent and obviously there was plenty of room. In the second trip we were 5 (including 2 adults) and there was still enough room for all of us and we brought some of our bags in too.\n\nIn our first trip it rained heavily in one of the nights. The tent held no problems. After 10 hours of relentless rain and some wind, we spotted a few drops in the tent but no more. It\'s a tent not a house, so I have no complains. It did it\'s job perfectly.On the second trip it was pretty warm and we enjoyed the fact that this thing has windows.I am 5\'11"" and I could stand in it right in the middle. There are nice pockets and a place to hang a lantern. The zippers gave us no problems.\n\nAssembly is simple but takes time and you need at least two people. Totally expected for a 6 person tent.The tent folds nicely back into the bag with all the poles and pegs and everything. It\'s not easy to do (come on Coleman! giving us an extra inch won\'t kill you!) but doable.\n\nOverall very happy with it and looking forward to using it again.', 'Tent is awesome! There is a story...the two of us arrived at the campground on a gorgeous blue sky day. We started reading the directions for set up. It definitely take two people to set up the tent. Not being the brightest tool in the toolbox, I thought it would be a good idea to get my phone out and follow a video since a first time set up is always a bit intimidating.\nWhen I opened the phone, a big red screen appeared with a weather alert. ""In 16 minutes, you are going to have torrential downpours with 65 mph winds, this is a dangerous storm, take cover immediately"". This can\'t be right, the sun is shining, the sky is blue, what the heck?! Yet, upon closer inspection, I asked my friend, does that sky look blue or gray to you over there? I checked the radar, sure nuff, freaking huge storm was coming!\nI don\'t think you ever saw two people put up this tent in record time. All of our stuff was unpacked and sitting out of the car. Holy moly, I was tying off the last anchor of the rain fly when the winds came. Grab the chairs (which were about to go into the lake). We ran into the tent and the rains came, the winds blew but by golly, that tent stayed strong. Not a drop of rain and it handled those winds like a dream! Amazing.\nWe had a queen size cot and a single, still had plenty of room. Love the tent!', 'So this review is from a long time ago. I bought this tent in 2012 and after reading several of the bad reviews on it thought I would put in my two cents. Some background- I am an Eagle Scout and have done a lot of camping. If this tent leaks its because you did not put it up properly. every thing should be tight, the rain fly should not touch the tent wall and you should have a tarp on the ground that is slightly larger than the tent with the extra curled under toward the ground so that when water runs off your tent it rolls around the tarp and to the ground.\n\nSo on to the review. I bought this tent to go camping with some friends in northern Alabama. we were going camping and rock climbing on top of a mountain. while we had check the weather and saw a hurricane developing in the gulf it was supposed to head for Texas so we decided to go and have some fun. the next day we spent all day rock climbing and forgot to check the weather again. that night we noticed a storm rolling in and pulled up the weather . A cat 3 Hurricane was headed right at us. we didn\'t have time to leave so we prepped the best we could. that night my friends tent was leaking all over the place so they stayed in mine. There was a 12"" river running under the middle of this tent. you didn\'t need an air mattress it was like sleeping on a waterbed. at some point in the middle of the night a small 6 in tree fell on the tent and it just brushed it off almost like nothing happened. It only broke one pole.\n\nIf you put this tent up properly it is a beast. and worth the money. All tents are only limited by how good you are at setting them up. Research, Practice, Fail, and try again! Good luck and happy camping!']","[[['NEGATIVE', 0.9990584254264832]], [['NEGATIVE', 0.9845029711723328]], [['NEGATIVE', 0.9916521906852722]], ['The text is too big to be classified'], [['NEGATIVE', 0.7698771953582764]], ['The text is too big to be classified'], [['POSITIVE', 0.9651703238487244]], [['POSITIVE', 0.9989795088768005]], [['POSITIVE', 0.5260893702507019]], [['NEGATIVE', 0.9898377656936646]]]"

In case you don’t understand what that means, let me explain it for you by telling you what it is NOT. This is not Mountain Hardwear, Marmot, North Face or any big name, high performance brand. It’s Coleman. You buy these at Walmart or Target, not REI. So understand that you make certain sacrifices in quality right off the bat with this tent and to complain about it is like buying a Chevy and getting upset that it doesn’t have the features, craftsmanship, or design of a BMW.\n\nThat being said, let’s talk about this tent.\n\nHere’s what I like: It sets up quickly, tears down just as fast, and you can still get everything back in the carrying bag it came with without giving yourself a hernia from overexerting. With the rainfly off, you get decent (although not great) ventilation for those hot summer nights. It’s roomy. I love the screen porch as an entry to kick shoes off in that greatly minimizes the amount of sand and dirt that ends up inside the tent itself and therefore inside my sleeping bag. The price. For $130, you can’t go wrong.\n\nHere’s what doesn’t thrill me: As other reviews mention, the rainfly does jack squat to protect anything in the screened porch from moisture in the event of rain. It will get wet. And the floor will get wet too and will probably pool up water. Which you will likely step in unknowingly in an early morning pre-dawn, coffeeless haze and slip and fall and completely soak yourself when all you were trying to do was to drain your middle aged bladder that can’t make it through one complete night in the flipping woods without waking you up. I mean, maybe you won’t. But someone could. Or did. But definitely not me. But hypothetically, I bet that would suck. Also, the back panel is a completely open screen. With the rainfly on, it provides no additional ventilation and seems pointless. With the fly off, it allows for ventilation but cannot be closed so there is no option for privacy. Then again, you’re in an 8-person tent. You gave up on the concept of privacy the moment you zippered yourself inside this nylon castle with a gaggle of other campers. Oh, and about the 8-person thing: that’s relative. Sure, 8 people if you’re cramming them in. Then again, why stop there? I bet the whole Thai soccer team could fit in this thing. But for us normal, slightly overweight Americans, 8-people is pushing it. I’d say 6 at best, and even then you’ll have to get creative. But I easily fit two queen-sized air mattresses for my four kids and had plenty of room for myself and all of our gear. There would’ve been room for their mother to join us too if she hadn’t run off with her bass player. But I digress... “8-person” is a bit generous.\n\nSo there you have it. All things considered, this is a pretty good tent. If it got too close to the fire and completely melted, or if a tree fell on it and rendered it useless, I’d buy it again. Probably.', 'Just camped out in Pocomoke River State Park, Maryland while Hurricane Matthew was battering North Carolina. Our camp site was filled with inches of water, wind was 20-30mph, rain coming from all directions and we were under a flash flood watch. The only thing dry was the inside of my Coleman Evanston tent. Bone dry. Thank you Coleman. Attached picture is take the day after the storm.', 'I\'m a 68 yr old senior who started camping as a child in the \'50s\nI\'d like to share my thoughts to any of the ""Haters"".\n\nI pitched this myself in about 25 mins - I don\'t hurry unless necessary\nIt went up in a very conventional dome tent style, though it\'s a long walk around if the pole comes off the pin\n(My weathermaster 6 has tight fitting clips for the poles)\n\nI think the elastic cord in the poles is ""Iffy"", given the weight of fiberglass poles, but if any break, they\'re easy to restring.\nMost of the tents I\'ve owned get new, better stakes - This one was put up with 8"" aluminum ""Y"" alloys - if I recall 16 of them\n\nI installed the fly on the windward side 1st, as any breeze will help pull it over the top\n\nJust looking at pics, I knew the porch would get wet, no big deal\n\nI knew this isn\'t a four season tent - My great Marmot Limestone 4 is far better, but sucks in summer unless I leave the rainfly open.\nThis tent is made to ventilate and keep you dry - which it seems to excel at.\n\nOverall, if you are respectful to the process of pitching and use, this tent\'s as good as any and a lot better than some other more expensive tents\n\n(I don\'t know how many tents I\'ve owned over the years (I\'m currently @ 10 LOL))\nThey all have a purpose - sub 3lb 1person backpackers to this thing.\n\nI\'m headed to Minn 8/8/17 for a week, hope it storms (I love storms)\n\nThanx for taking the time to read this\nGreg', ""The best tent ... EVER !! Goes up quick & easy. Looks great. I bought it for just my husband & I ~ so it's wonderfully roomy. Love the ' porch '. I put up a queen air mattress and used a rubbermaid tote as an ' end table' in the tent proper. Battery candles - cute & safe. I put a little camp table & two chairs on the porch - tho we had good weather and never really needed to sit in there. But, it would have been perfectly comfortable to hang out and play cards, drink wine, whatever - if we had. Can't say enough good things. Bought it on Prime and received it within two days. I love my tent. And so does my dog, Sugar !!"", 'I do more camping than most, multiple times per year, for the past 20 years, and I also have 5 kiddos under the age of 9. I don\'t do pay sites, and I don\'t do RV camping. I do straight up real, primitive camping, in the mountains.\n\nAbout rain getting through to the screened-in porch area, yes that\'s unfortunate. Just look at the weather beforehand, or if you\'re in an area like Yellowstone that can hail, rain, snow, and have burning sun in a matter of 15 mins, just tie tarps above it. Not a problem guys. Seriously. Real campers don\'t whine, we simply get creative. Plus, I always put tarps underneath my tents.\n\nAnyways, the ventilation is SOOOO good that it doesn\'t cause any condensation. Condensation is when it\'s cold outside (Maybe 40 degrees or below while inside your body heat warms up the tent, creating condensation on the INSIDE WALLS, exactly like a cold glass of water on a warm day creates condensation on the OUTSIDE WALLS of the glass (which is like the INSIDE WALLS of the tent, the warm side)). I had some tents without good ventilation where I had to use like half a roll of GOOD quality Bounty paper towel to clean up the nasty condensation EVERY MORNING when the temperature was cold outside during the night. When it\'s like high 50s F outside at night (i.e. if you just camp in your back yard, or low elevation areas), condensation doesn\'t form inside because the temperature difference is not enough to cause condensation to form. In other words, on warm nights (or low altitudes like your backyard), the outside air isn\'t cold enough to cause the inside air with high humidity (or specifically the water molecules in the air) to lose their energy to the outside (as energy/heat transfers from a higher energy/heat area (inside) to the lower energy area (outside)), and thus higher energy ""gaseous"" water molecules in the air inside the tent loses their energy and then forms liquid water, on the sides of the cold tent walls. It\'s not because the rain came through guys... seriously, stop whining at the tent makers. It\'s called C O N D E N S A T I O N. Look it up. Thermodynamics 101 guys/girls. If you paid attention to basic Chemistry and Physics courses in high school, you\'d know this. But most of you failed!\n\nANYWAYS, the ventilation is so good (basically the entire back side is opened, with just a thin tent wall between you and the freezing air), that on cold nights, you will literally freeze to death, especially if you sleep your heads immediately underneath that back area. Good luck with the migraines. So how I solved this was I simply cut up two clear plastic trash bags (but you can use white, black etc.), and tied them up together at the edges to make it ""longer length wise"", and then OUTSIDE the tent, I tied the two ends above the poles as high as possible. Tape didn\'t work with these clear plastic trash bags (although tape works great on black trash bags), so I got creative and poked a little hole near the corner of the trash bag corner tip, tied the corner of the trash bag around the tent pole, and then into the hole, knotted it, and got it to stay on that way. See pictures. By using this quick makeshift method, I basically prevented a big opening on the sides and bottom of the back end of the tent, thus preventing the cold air from freezing me and my family to death.\n\nThe only real con I didn\'t like were the two holes on either corner where the tent and the screened-in porch attaches. I\'m sure they did this to drain out water for those people who position the tent in such a way where the ground is not horizontal and water pools inside the tent. These holes unfortunately are so big that it allows nasty big spiders in, so I took pictures with a various objects to give you a general idea. I simply plugged them with toilet paper... Again, if you use a tarp above, or position your tent so the higher ground is on the back side with the opening on the lower ground, and/or use tarps above tied to trees etc., water pooling shouldn\'t be a problem.\n\nTwo ""OT QOMOTOP Ultra Thick Self-Inflating Camping Mattress, Ultra Comfortable Side Sleep Friendly 4 Inches Thick Sleeping Pad, 80""×28""(Single)/52""(Double), Portable Roll-Up Floor Guest Bed, Blue/Gray"" fits in this tent.', 'I was a little skeptical about this tent, since the price was lower than your average tent, however, I am very impressed.\nI took this tent to a music festival, where we camped for 5 days. Here is my feedback:\n- Tent is very easy to put together, it took 10 minutes at most to get it up and stable.\n- Take down is just as easy, just a matter of how well you can roll it up and fit it back into the bag. that was our biggest challenge.\n- Stands up well to rain: it poured pretty severely one night and the tent inside stayed completely dry with the rain guard over.\n- The screened in porch got soaked though, I don\'t recommend leaving anything there if it\'s going to rain. It also kind of hard to get the water out, so if you know it will rain, I would recommend maybe putting an additional tarp over it.\n- We put a tarp down and put the tent on top of it for additional rain protection, so I would recommend that as well.\n- It\'s pretty massive, we had two queen size air mattresses and all of our bags and still had plenty of space. It was also very tall. I am 5\'3"" and I can stand up fully and even put my arms up.\n- The tent packs away great, very compact.\n\nOverall, for the price, I am very impressed and would use it again and buy it again.', 'Coleman continues to impress me with their affordable outdoor equipment. There\'s always a fine line between cost/reliability with products, and when you\'re in the wilderness you don\'t want to be left out in the cold. I\'ve come to depend on Coleman products for this reason.\n\nPrior to this, I camped with my Coleman Sundown tent, which I swore by for the simple fact that it could be set up and torn down in five minutes. My dog and I fit fine, but if he was wet and it was raining, forget it. Mess everywhere. Now I camp with my gf and my dog and it came tike to expand. Enter the Evanston. We just came back from Lake George camping, where it endured several random torrential downpours and lots of ""in and out.""\n\nA good rule of thumb when buying a tent is to look at the number of people it says it\'s for, and subtract by 2. I chose this one simply for the ""porch"" feature, which I\'ll expand on below.\n\nSet up:\nAs easy as any tent, really. Do yourself a favor and mark with colored tape the tent poles so at a glance you\'ll know which ones are which next time you set up. It can be set up by one person if necessary, but two people is optimal for ease of use.\n\nCleanup/ Tear Down:\nBecause of the ridge pole holding the porch section, it\'s a little trickier. Use a towel or shirt to brush away the debris that inevitably tracks in.\n\nDurability:\n8/10.\nNo rips or tears, no cracked zipper components. A little bit of moistness seeped into the corners from the rain, however. We did not use sealant, which I suspect would have prevented this entirely.\n\nSpace:\n10/10 for two people and a dog, 6/10 for four people and two dogs!\nA couple of our friends arrived late and opted to set up their tent in the morning, so we hosted them in ours. It was a bit tight, but definitely doable. Points subtracted here because the main tent door placement required some seriously precarious stepping over each other to get to. Not a great situation for those 3am ""find a tree"" moments. But the dogs were happy, and everyone had their own ""roll around"" area.\n\nThe Porch:\n6/10.\nThe usefulness here was two fold. It served to keep some items away from the elements and to trap the dirt from entering the tent. The biggest problem is that the rain fly doesn\'t cover the mesh covering, so heavy rain will get in. I covered a majority of our items.\nIt did however, keep dirt and debris out.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this tent for those seeking a relaxed and enjoyable tent if it\'s going to be set up for a couple of days.', 'We didn\'t want to drop hundreds of dollars for a tent we\'d use once or twice a year. This tent worked great for us. The large size was great to not feel crowded; we had two adults (one with a twin-size air mattress) and a child sleeping in it. The airflow and system for the rain cover to overhang the side windows worked great. Having an exterior area door (we call it the ""porch"") worked great to keep insects out of the main sleeping area.\n\nDuring setup, minimally, you\'ll need two stakes for the front ""porch"" corners. Also, you\'ll need to tie the opposite-side rain-fly guy line to pull it away from the tent. This could be to a tree though and makes a reasonable clothes line for a few items.\n\nMinor negative items:\n- the ""porch"" area collects water during rain as it\'s not well covered by the rain cover. It drains at the front only. You must setup this tent with the front door down-hill to ensure drainage. This isn\'t a big deal but does slightly limit your options if you want the front to face other tents or the picnic table.\n- it\'s really heavy, largely due to size. You can\'t have everything here, if you want ""glamping"" size you have to carry it. This is fine for car-camping or short hike-in camp-sites but don\'t expect to carry this thing real far.', ""For a family of four, I am glad I purchased a 6-person tent! I was able to fit three twin size mattresses and one portable mat/pad with plenty of room to hold several miscellaneous camping items, and two backpacks inside the main sleeping area. We were able to attach two small lanterns and two small pouches inside the tent gave us the ability to hold car keys, wallets, and phones. We did not have any major issues with this tent during our camping trips.\n\nGood items to note:\n\n- Getting the tent installed is super easy, but I highly recommend reading the instructions at least once and installing the tent in your backyard before your first camping trip. It took about 15 to 20 minutes to get everything installed during our first camping trip and about 20 minutes to put everything away. Take time to fold the tent properly or you won't be able to fit all of the items inside the storage bag.\n- The tent was able to keep all of the annoying and nasty bugs outside and good ventilation inside the tent at night.\n- I was able to stand straight up in the main sleeping area which was convenient and I didn't expect this.\n- The screen area will not be dry during rain, but this should not be a surprise from the design of the tent, but it will hold three portable chairs as an escape from annoying flies and mosquitoes.\n\nSeveral concerns:\n\n- Two bottom corners in the screen area were not sealed properly and I am not sure if this is by design or the two areas that I noticed were ripped during installation. This was a concern because I didn't want any ants inside the tent, but we didn't have any problems during our camping trips.\n- I highly recommend purchasing heavy duty ten spikes and don't allow your teenager daughter to hammer the smaller spikes that come with the tent unless you are willing to dedicate one hour of your time making them straight again. :-)\n\nOverall, I am happy with the tent and it will last us for several years and I will update this review after our third and fourth camping trips."", ""Bought this tent months ago for a camping trip with the family. Covid 19 happened and it never happened. My brand new Colman 8 person tent was sitting up in our closet collecting dust. Fast forward to August 27th 2020. Hurricane Laura tore through Southern Louisiana. We have been fortunate to not have too much damage. Our power is out however and will be out for weeks. Sooooo. We are camping in our back yard :). The tent is great! Roomy. Big enough for our queen air mattress with headboard. Also the tent breaths really well. Even with this hot humid heat, we can relax inside with the widows open. We have to rainfly up due to the fact in the mornings the humidity is high and there is due everywhere. Also Louisiana thunderstorms are extremely unpredictable. It rained once sense we set it up and i have to say. None of our things inside the tent got a drop on them. However if your have things on the porch they will get wet.\n\nOne minor glitch however. (And its strictly on me for not preparing the area properly) but make sure to lay down a blanket and/or tarp before setting up your tent. I looked over the spot before I set up the tent for roots and twigs and stuff. The area seemed clear. However after the third night camping out, I noticed a small root wearing away the material where we walk in the tent. Its not a bad hole, but it'll definitely need patching later.\n\nAll in all. We love this tent. It's a great place to have when you have to rough it after a hurricane ripped through your neighborhood.

Maybe it doesn\'t matter in the end, but I carefully consider other peoples reviews when making purchases that are a bit pricey and I won’t have an opportunity to change my mind once in the woods so I’m hoping my review helps you in deciding on this tent or not. I needed a tent that would last me for several weeks and not fail. I had a limited budget and a lot to consider such as size, durability, rain resistance and ease of set up.\n\nIf all you want to know bottom line up front, is this tent worth the $200+/-, yes, yes it is.\nIt is big, allowed me to fit a queen size bed with a ton of room to spare, is tall enough and utilizes space well enough that is was truly a joy to go camping. There was no bending over or loss of space due to size. The cube shape is fantastic!\n\nOkay, so here are the benefits:\n• Extremely ventilated!!! The large windows and vented ceiling is a HUGE bonus, allowing for a maximum airflow you just don\'t regularly experience in tents\n• Rain flaps around all the windows and door frame. Wow, it rained A LOT while camping and we stayed totally dry. The front rain flap is also a con but I’ll explain why later.\n• Tub style bottom. While it came with a very water resistant bottom, we still added a ground tarp for extra security. But again, as mentioned above, we had a couple days of non-stop rain and it stayed very dry in the tent. The floor stayed dry and the sides stayed dry.\n• Tall! I\'m not huge at 5\'8 so I had no problem. But even if I was a few inches taller I would still have plenty of head room.\n• Big! When we had several others camping with us we had a queen size and twin mattress side-by-side and still had room for all our bags and gear.\n• Material - The material is light but strong. It is also sewn very well, with even stitches and a clear adhesive tape over all the stitching to keep water out and protect the thread. The tent is pretty darn well made and while the material is a light weight tent material, I saw no signs of weakening by the end of the trip and that is with falling against the sides several times for various reasons - late night bathroom breaks and tripping and what not.\n• The straps and tie downs: I read several reviews about the tent not fitting peoples pop-up canopies but I just don\'t see how that could be a problem if you got a straight leg 10x10 or as I got, a 10x20. The ceiling strap offers two options to accommodate whatever style pop up you have. So if you need it taller, it\'s got that option. You need it shorter, has that option too! The side clasps for hooking onto the bars were easy to put on and take off. The velcro allowed enough wiggle room to make it tighter or looser. All around it should pretty well fit any pop up and you can adjust.\n\nCons: *and as you’ll see, are pretty few*\n• THE FRONT ZIPPER!!!! All the window zippers were fine. Let me be clear, I had no issues with those. But the front door.... and this is why I struggled so hard with giving a 5 star rating... Not one time in the entire two weeks of using this tent did the front zipper not get caught while trying to open the doorway. EVERY SINGLE TIME it got caught. Major design flaw. It got caught right at the top or bottom where the rain guard was stitched. I was so close to just cutting the damn thing off from frustration. This is also where it makes a difference however if you don’t have an awning which if you have a 10x10 pop up and it rains, you’ll want that guard. But with my tent and pop up, I just wanted to rip it off with my teeth I was so frustrated. The zipper really sucked. Don’t get me wrong, it\'s heavy duty, but is stitched terribly.\n• The ventilation could also be a negative. On cold nights there is no way to cover the ceiling vent. So in the summer, under a sturdy frame, it\'s a blessing. But don\'t be fooled, this is NOT a 3/4 season tent. It\'s only really good for warm weather.\n\nNot positive or negative, just my thoughts:\n• The dog door. It\'s not really a con, but I don\'t know anyone, including myself, who will just open the door for a dog while camping and say, go ahead pooch, go on out there yourself. Or leave a dog in the tent alone and let them out the dog door. It was just kind of stupid. I can see why it might be helpful in some situations, such as if you had a cooler or shoes there, but why would you leave your shoes on the side where they could get rained on? And you really wouldn\'t be able to reach inside a cooler from the bottom of the tent. I could live without it and I have dogs. I think it’s just a silly marketing ploy for people who have dogs but it’s not actually practical.\n• One the ""benefits"" is the front door mat they say comes with the tent. <_< I\'ll be honest with you, I laughed when I saw it. I would just throw it out. Useless. Too cheap of a material to withstand being walked on and not really a secure way to stake it down. I got a tarp large enough that I just made my own front walk to park my shoes. Next year I\'ll be adding an outdoor carpet and that should really do the trick.\n\nA note on popups: If you haven’t figured it out by now, this tent does not include a pop up. You have to buy that separate. And, you get what you pay for. I\'ll say it again. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR! I would not recommend using this tent with a cheap pop up canopy. I actually looked at a few EZUP\'s (the same brand as the cube tent) - which this tent is made for, and thankfully decided against it. They are cheap cheap cheap. I paid $400 for my pop up and it was worth every single penny. I also took a gamble because I couldn\'t find anyone else that had tried it, but got a 10x20 so I would have an awning. It was so worth it. I know it\'s a different company and a different product, but I got the ABC Canopy Pop Up 10x20. It works really well with the tent. It\'s heavy duty, and while you can\'t really see it in the picture, the canopy itself is a much sturdier material than the cheaper EZUP and Walmart Ozark Trails versions. The frame was solid, the canopy was solid and it withstood extreme winds and rain at our campground while I saw a lot of cheaper pop ups collapse or bend or leak.\n\nI guess that’s it and up to you now and what you want to do. I hope you found this review helpful and happy camping.', 'I wanted to get this review out there as I was having trouble finding out this information before using the tent. Setup is super easy. I am using a Z-Shade 10\' Straight Leg Canopy that I had already owned and the only modification I had to do was use a few short bungee straps on one side to ensure it was not pulling to tight. Using a E-z up canopy the fitment is exact. When you use the velcro don\'t strap them too tight and give yourself some extra play. Same with the plastic clips holding it to the frame. Start a bit loose and snug it up. Only takes a few minutes to get it perfect.\n\nMOST IMPORTANTLY the doggie door is the exact size of a Arctic King 5000 BTU window unit air conditioner from Walmart. The A/C Unit fitment is so perfect you would think it\'s made for it. You just need something to prop the window unit 6"" off the ground. We had the entire tent sitting at 72 degrees during a 100 degree summer day. The included bag is great, and holds it easily. Could not be happier with it!', 'It\'s kind of a funny story. We received the tent about a week before it was time to go on our scheduled camping trip. My husband came home and was so excited it came, that he wanted to set it up to ""practice"". Low and behold, it was a tent with no sides or supports. When I ordered it, I neglected to comprehend in the explanation that it was an add on to the E-Z Up canopy. I rushed in the house and there it was, in black and white on the product description. We frantically attempted to order from Amazon a canopy in time for our vacation. The only one we could get on time was a royal blue canopy instead of the white or limeade we wanted. Nonetheless, its wonderful. We arrived when it was almost dark to our campsite and were able to set it up in the dark. Neither of us had camped since childhood an we are in our 60\'s now. We love the look, the size, and well almost all of the colors! I would give it about 10 stars, and its extremely well built Kudos EZ-UP.\nNadine Brown-Silver\nAlbany, NY', 'I recently purchased this tent for the Fourth of July. I was excited about the purchase as it clearly states, it is WATER RESISTANT and STURDY. You can imagine my excitement when my family spends 11 days tenting. The second day of the trip it rained. The entire tent bent and collapsed just from water alone. I am very disappointed I spent my hard earned money on a product I thought I could trust. I am now without a tent for the rest of the trip due to the lies I believed, as well as having to find a dryer in town because everything in the tent was soaked. I will never be buying a product from this company again.', ""We love this tent!!!\n\nNote we only put it up so far in the front yard as a test run. As far as weather resistance I cant give a review because I haven't used it in wind or rain.\n\nBought a mosquito net wall set for a 10' x 10' canopy for the front screened in porch.\n\nOne con is that the cube doesn't work well with our center cross beams...if you look at the pics the middle at the top you can see some of the blue ceiling on the outside. There is a support beam that runs across our canopy there and prevents us from clipping that edge all the way up like the corners. That isn't a big deal to me(would rather have the sturdier canopy) but figured it's worth mentioning. Nothing wrong with the product it's just the way our canopy is designed.\n\nOur canopy is a 10' by 20'."", 'I\'m a 60-yo woman and I set up the canopy (ABCCanopy) and this tent by myself in a remote area in about 15 min.\nThe tent is very sturdy and airy -- it has screens on all 4 sides as well as a screened opening in the top. The tent does NOT support itself -- it is an addon to any straight-legged 10\'x10\' canopy. It has lots of nice touches inside, like pockets for small items and loops for hanging a string of lights or anything else around the ceiling.\n\nThe sturdiness of the whole setup depends very much on the quality of the canopy you start with. Buy a good one.\n\nFor the record, since I set this up in a breezy area, I also got a set of heavy augur anchors to anchor it down with.\n\nI don\'t know how waterproof it is in a heavy rain. I think I would want to add a 2-ft ""valance"" around the inside of the canopy overhang if I expected windy storms.\n\nLike any tent, this is pretty toasty in direct sunlight. You can see I just clamped a tarp (a painter\'s dropcloth) to the side to add shade.\n\nMy hope is to make this a base camp tent for working remotely ""working from home"" haha. It has plenty of room for living and working as a remote office. In that event I will want to add a box fan. You could go all-in and get an air conditioner and locate it at the ""pet door"", which is perfectly located for something like AC.', ""Holy cow!\n\nMy family has car-camped with this kind of tent for almost ten years. I love this because it's quick to set up, there's plenty of room, and an adult can stand up straight. BE AWARE, that this item is only the TENT. A straight-leg awning is also required, and must be purchased separately.\n\nThis tent insert is made from heavier materials than the one I've used for years, is assembled with attention to detail, and uses very good fasteners, zippers, and hooks. The hooks fit the square tubing used in E-Z Up straight-leg awnings with precision, and seem to be very durable (time will tell). Where the precision hooks aren't used, heavy-duty hook-n-loop faster (Velcro) is used. The zippers work well, and don't jam when the tent is stretched between the legs of the awning.\n\nThe doggy door and the extension - cord portals definitely strike me as high-end accessories, but if you have a dog or have ever camped on a site with electricity, you can pretty quickly appreciate those touches.\n\nI'm very impressed. Even at this price level, I didn't expect the kind of quality that I discovered when we used this."", 'Welcome to The Blue Palace, our glamping investment to endure this pandemic. We fit a queen bed frame, 6” trifold memory foam mattress, two endtables, a fan, and most importantly, a chandelier!! Plenty of room to walk around the bed, so much ventilation, easy setup and tear down, and easy storage in our SUV. An AC in the doggie door might be next as we approach the Florida summer. In the meantime, we LOVE this cube and shelter combo!! We have safe and comfy adventure back in our lives.', ' We essentially lived out of this tent for 3 months. Traveled the country in it with 2 kids. Went through an entire 24hrs of 45mph GUSTS and 20mph continuous winds!!! Had to lower top canopy, stake on all 4 corners and string down the top canopy at the corners and it held up. Bit scary but that was at the beginning of the trip. During heavy rainstorms a few drips did come in from the top but just a few through the night. Only complaint is the door zipper is a PIA to open and close as the zipper gets caught in the rain/zipper protector flap. Other then that the tent is super easy and quick to put up and take down. For a tent this thing is really nice. We have used Coleman’s 8x14 instant tents and other toss up tents over the decades for weekend camping…Would not hesitate on purchasing this one again if for whatever reason had to.', ""My husband found this after setting up our regular tents and realizing we are too old (early 50s) to be bending over to get in and out of a tent. We ordered it and it came in the Friday before Father's Day, his gift. We already owned a straight leg canopy. We set it up in our backyard as a trial run. IT IS AMAZING! It took us a half hour for the initial setup. It'll get easier now we know what we're doing. I did notice an area under the main doors that was so thin it let light through. I contacted customer service for EZUP through their chat and showed her the pictures that I took of it. She stated it was a manufacturers defect and gave me the link to file a claim. Within 48 hrs of me submitting the pictures and proof of purchase, my claim was approved and I received a brand new EZUP Cube in one week at no charge whatsoever. We haven't been able to set up the new one due to the daily rain. But we do HIGHLY recommend it and their Customer Service is awesome also! The pet door is perfect for your portable AC exhaust to be vented out. We put a queen size air mattress in it and it has lots of room left. One of my daughters is into tent camping and is looking into also purchasing one.

Wanted to see the outdoors, but also wanted protection from the rain. Decided to buy a coleman tent instead as my ""she shed"". I can\'t get my husband out of it! We hang out there in evenings alone....without the bugs. Been camping since I was a child, about 50 years.\n\nAll windows open for good breeze, yet you can close up tent for privacy or rain, & my furniture stays dry. Small ceiling loops inside tent to hang lightweight lights. Also, flap for running electricity without the bugs getting in is great. Remember to make sure to secure the tent properly for wind & storm protection. It must be attached to something to secure it in place. Well worth the money. Coleman is on the ball, and I wouldn\'t buy anything but coleman. You get what you pay for!', ""The tent was easy to set up. I highly recommend doing it with two people. We had only one point when we were confused as to what to do. It was in putting the rainfly on and the red pole that is the front door overhang. It wasn't obvious where the pole went but we eventually figured it out. The instructions are very generic and didn't address this part of assembly.\n\nIt is very big which was perfect for our family of 5. We camp with 3 twin air mattresses and a DiscOBed bunk bed. There is plenty of room for this set up and for maneuvering around. It is definitely tall enough for standing upright.\n\nLarge windows were great for ventilation!\n\nThe only concern will be making sure we get camping spots that can accommodate it.\n\nLove this tent so far!"", 'Our family really enjoyed using this tent on our camping trip. It is very roomy, fairly easy to set up with 2 people, and was completely weatherproof through rain showers and fog/mist. It also looks really nice, if that matters to you.\n\nIt is very well ventilated when fully closed, though still warm when 55 F outside at night (felt like 68-70F inside). No condensation built up inside the tent, which was a nice surprise.\n\nSeems like tent would work very well for warm conditions too, since there are lots of very large windows.\n\nThe tent is a little pricey at $340, but maybe it was just poor timing to get the best price.\n\nWe only had a few issues with the tent:\n\nInstructions\n\nThe instructions are mostly clear, but it would still be nice to include a little info about the room divider and entrance mat in the instructions. Also, the instructions for takedown would be much better if they suggested a folding pattern to get the tent to ""pole width"". We folded it in half twice length-wise and it was just a little too wide to fit in the bag (we will test folding along the shorter side after it dries out in our garage). It is mainly due to the frustration of trying to get the tent into the bag (and the lack of documentation on how to best do so) that we are docking it a star.\n\nDamage\n\nFairly minor, but there was a factory-installed patch on the floor of the tent (mostly a cosmetic ""issue"") and one of the guy lines was frayed.\n\nSuggestion to Coleman:\n\nAdd stripes on the bottom of the tent to indicate where to fold to guarantee that the tent can be stored in its bag.', ""It poured the first night we used this tent and it stayed completely dry inside. It was super easy to put up with the color coding system. Love that it's tall enough to stand straight up inside. We fit a queen size air mattress, baby pack-and-play, large dog bed and 2 large suit cases and still had a pathway to walk. Very happy with this purchase."", 'Super durable so far. We’ve used it this season several times for weekend camping. It’s easy to put up and take down. It had plenty of space inside for everything.', 'Ony Coleman for me!!', 'Really a nice tent! Before unpacking, the box/carrying bag measured approximately 24”x11”x11”. A pretty small carrying case for a tent that sleeps eight, I thought.\n\nAs my son and I began to unpack the tent, we were pleasantly surprised to find that the setup instructions were printed on plastic sheets, sewn into the carrying case. Ingenious! They will never get lost; never wash out if they get wet; and always be available. Very nice!\n\nUsing the instructions, we laid out the tent as prescribed. It took a couple of tries, but we finally did get it set up. Total set up time for the first try was about 45 minutes. I would imagine subsequent times will be less. Watching the setup video on the Amazon web site would help you.\n\nThe tent has nice storage pouches inside. A place to hang a light from the top of the tent. A vent in the back, and windows that really let the breeze through, even with the rain fly installed. It also has a plastic mat that you can place in front of the tent entrance to help keep the tent clean inside. Lots of nice touches.\n\nI was concerned that a large tent would be difficult to re-pack into the storage bag. The first thing I did was to remove the tear-away strip at the bottom of the bag. The strip says “Remove to Expand Bag” (see photo). Tearing away the strip does add a lot of expansion capability to the bag.\n\nFolding the tent for storage is a process. What we found works best (and somewhat spelled out in the instructions), was to first open all windows (all zippered flaps open). Then, remove all tent poles, fold them, and place them in their storage bag. Next, remove the tent stakes. Then, with one person at the front of the tent, and one at the back of the tent, fold the tent into four, long, equally spaced sections. When finished, the tent should be as wide as the storage bag for the folding poles. Place the folded poles onto the back section of the folded tent. Role the tent towards the door, allowing trapped air to escape. When finished, the tent should be as wide as the bag of folded poles and will fit relatively easily back into the storage bag.\n\nOverall, I would rate this as five stars and would recommend this to a friend. I’ve not yet had a chance to use the tent for camping, so I can’t comment on being water proof or on warmth.\n\nIf you find this review helpful, please click the “Helpful” button below. Thank you.', 'Love It!', 'Door is hard to open and close, to much tension on the material for the zipper to operate. We removed the stakes to lessen the tension with no luck. Door is big, large enough to walk an assembled cot thru with no trouble. The door is truly the only complaint I have.\nEnough of my complaining. 12 person tent is huge, plenty of height for a 6’2” to walk in without ducking. Setup was straight forward and easy for two people. Poles are excellent, beefy enough to support the large canopy. Did not rain on us, so I cannot rate it’s waterproofing. Definitely a warm weather tent with plenty of windows', 'Not sure I like or not but this has entire top screened which vents out moisture (good) and heat (less good unless in Arizona to Florida)\nThe fly flap over the entry door was way too short! In rain, water would drain off it and thru the bottom of the door. Had to rig up a tarp to handle that.\nBut overall generally good for the price point']","[[['POSITIVE', 0.9894787669181824]], [['POSITIVE', 0.9271325469017029]], [['NEGATIVE', 0.9971508383750916]], [['POSITIVE', 0.9989206790924072]], [['POSITIVE', 0.9976019263267517]], [['POSITIVE', 0.9993247985839844]], ['The text is too big to be classified'], [['POSITIVE', 0.9998776912689209]], [['POSITIVE', 0.9951192140579224]], [['NEGATIVE', 0.9786014556884766]]]"

Assemble the poles, slip them into the roof ""slips"", insert them into the corner holding slots, raise the tent and you\'re good to go. The little rain ""cap"" looks a bit flimsy, but should protect and provide ventilation in all but the most heavy of rainstorms. Operate the zippers GENTLY, and pull-together-align the sections you want to zip...\nAn additional cover-tarp might be recommended for severe weather-use.\nAll parts fit handily into the carry bag, and the whole system is very lightweight, like for back-packers...\nOK, for 18-bucks, essential shelter is accomplished.

Exxxcellent.', ""My brother and I each bought one of of these tents for 2 nights of camping in the north woods of Wisconsin. My other friends had tents costing 5 times more than this, but we all woke up refreshed and dry every morning. It packs up small, and the build quality isn't spectacular (there was a section of the bag that wasn't sewn correctly), but the zippers didn't rip on me or let in any bugs or rain (it rained one night). The kicker is that these were the quickest tents to be set up and taken down every evening and morning respectively. Since it's small, I wouldn't buy one if you're > 6 feet tall. I'm 5'6 and slept diagonally, yet had room for my pillow plus a few inches to spare."", 'Granted, this was really more like a backyard tent, this is not something you want to go out into the yukon with, but it is fantastic for what I needed, which was a tent that was small enough to fit on the back of my flatbed mini Kei truck, as shown in the photos. This fit absolutely perfect on there and had the right square footprint and all AND It was the right color to match!

Way bigger than the pictures make it look. Very easy to set up. I was drunk, barefoot and it was in the middle of the night with only one flashlight the first time I set it up and it only took five mins. Also, the takedown is extremely easy. With a major hangover, minimal sleep and still no shoes it only took 10 mins to get it back in the bag. Highly recommended for family outings or if you need a small apartment sized tent for yourself. It didn't rain on it yet so more review to follow when I get caught in a rainstorm.\n\nYear later update: tent still rules\n\n3 year update: still going strong. Great quality.\n\n4year update: still going good. Discovered this year it is possible to set up while sober! Pretty cool."", '3 year update!! Just used this tent for a 3 night camping trip in the mountains, got hit with 2 massive thunderstorms, and it held up pretty good. Just slight leakage by the seam on the door. Only a tiny spot of water on the floor in the morning. I’ve used this tent for at least 7-8 camping trips in the last 3 years, it holds up very well. I would still recommend purchasing this tent. :)\n\nOriginal review: Let me start off by saying, this is the best tent I have ever used. This tent is MASSIVE. I was able to fit a queen air mattress, twin mattress, cooler and tote, and there was still plenty of room. The second night using this, a thunderstorm rolled in, not a drop got in the tent. Was super sturdy to the wind and rain. So happy I made this purchase. Using it again this weekend.', 'nice tent. very roomy. I like being outside but do not like getting sunburned or bitten by bugs. this tent zips up securely. it is my home away from home. I have a chair and a small table and electricity and an air mattrass.\n\nbefore you get the tent buy a tarp to go under it. I got 2 6x8 and laced them together. I got them at the local big box and did not write down the tent size. they were just right.\n\nnow for the tent stakes. THROW THEM AWAY. I took one look at them and realizes they were useless. I have had 2 sports brellas since 2012 that I have used to death. they keep the sun off but do not help with bugs. I dug out the tent stakes from the sports brellas and used the junk ones for the tarp and the rain fly, they are ok for the tarp but do not use them for rain fly.\n\nwe got two days of torrential rain and heavy wind. the joke tent pegs attached to the rain fly pulled loose pulled loose and I did get rain in the tent.. otherwise everything stood up very well.\n\nputting it up was a bit of a bear.. get the tarp on the ground, lay the tent out ant stake the corners with the good stakes you purchased . put the long and short rods threw the correct pockets. this is important. the bottom of the rain fly has velcro. while it still on the ground attach the rain fly with the velcro to the tent. otherwise you end up trying to toss a very slippery king sized piece of fabric six feet in the air over another piece of slippery fabric. this activity will produce a signifilcant amount of swearing and amusement for the neighbors.\n\nat this point as i am not very tall i got my husband to get in the tent and hold up the middle while i wrestled the long and short poles into the eye screws attached to the tent peg. you will need to use these pegs that come with the tent. it is an odd setup but it works. throw the rest away. there was some swearing at this point as it is difficult to get the poles hooked into the the little eye things but both the tent and i survived\n\nset it up so the windows are in the path of the prevailing wind so you get nice breeze and enjoy.', "" Used it once and it happened to rain pretty good here in SC, with rain fly on water poured in like nothing watch the video...Don't waste your money on this."", 'Very nice tent for the money. Very spacious. With the rainfly, airflow is limited.\n\nBiggest gripe and why I took off a star: WHEN DESIGNER’S DECIDE HOW BIG A STORAGE BAG NEEDS TO BE, THEY NEED TO ADD 20% MORE SPACE TO THE BAG.\n\nI spent about 20 minutes in freezing rain, cursing Core 9 while trying to get the tent back in the the tiny storage bag. Bag could stand to be much bigger. Especially if you want to throw in some decent tent spikes (i.e. not what ships with the tent) and a mallet.\n\nBut now that I have that off my chest, this tent really is fantastic.', ""LOVE this tent! Comfortably slept a family of six (mother-in-law included), easily set up in the dark, and kept us dry during a surprise shower! Can not recommend enough! Bonus: other campers came over to marvel at it's size and awesomeness, making my husband feel like the King of The Campground."", ' We wanted a tent with some space left after putting a queen side bed inside. Searched a lot and read several reviews and watched videos. Finally we decided for this 9x16 Core tent. First of all, we really liked the color combination which we thing it will very well fit in the natural environment. When we read about the specs it included everything we were looking for. Especially, the center height was something that we cared for and since you can stand in this tent it became one of our favorite. I agree that there are several other options but it also has to be affordable. Core has quality products which does not hurt your budget.\n\nWhen it arrived we assembled it and it’s huge. When it says you can have 3 queen beds fitted inside it was true :) this is definitely a nice family tent with nice space. We gonna use it for a bed and some room to sit inside if necessary.\n\nHaving cable access port, led lamp hanging option on the top, rain cover is nice. The bottom is like a tarp and if you don’t have one you can use it without. Material is great.\n\nAssembling with extra hands was below 15 minutes. Straightforward, no instructions needed. They provide one.\n\nEverything comes in a nice bag which is big enough to have everything again back inside.\n\nWill update my review after our next camping with more pictures.\n\nHappy with the purchase and highly recommend this tent.', 'UPDATE TO MY REVIEW BELOW...\n\nTrue, this tent did leak on our ""test run,"" however, I have to bump up my review because the Custome Service was GREAT! They very quickly replaced the defective part. We\'ll give it another try with the new part! My plan is to reinforce the seams with a water proofing spray. I\'ll try to share how that goes too! If successful, this tent will be a good deal for the cost compared to other tents on the market. Wish me luck!\n\nOriginal review...\nI bought this tent for my young family to continue my family tradition of an annual camping & rafting trip. Last night we had our ""test run"" in our backyard. We had a leak!!! Woke up at 2 am sleeping in a puddle with rain dripping down on us. Looks like a defective seam seal in the rain fly was to blame. I\'m happy we did a test run & we could just head inside! I\'ve emailed the company to see if they can send me a replacement. If they can\'t, I\'ll be returning it. I\'ll be inspecting the rain fly seams before we bother giving it another try this time too!\nOther than the leak, the tent is nice! I do wish the zippers on the door ran a little bit more smoothly, but obviously the leak is a much bigger issue. Hopefully that can be resolved!', 'This 9 x 12 Core tent was easy to set up by myself. It’s a perfect companion for my NTK 10x12 Colorado. I do a lot of camping and since tents today are small packed in the bag I take 2 tents in case one fails due to tree branches, leaks etc. I realize that the fly on the ends could be almost closed or wide open depending on how far you stake it. Allowing more or less air to enter which comes in handy depending on temperature. The door could use some improvement where the 2 rain flaps meet. Most tents use 1 rain flap over the zippers. Zippers were smooth. I own 5 tents three off them smaller for solo camping the 2 mentioned for family camping. I was going to get an instant pop up tent but when I saw the footprint of the bag it’s way too large. My 2 tents take up less room in my vehicles. Overall it is a great tent and would recommend it. Even though I bought it used the box was never opened. Since this is a larger tent I recommend getting 10 or 12 inch stakes so it can handle winds and rain. This was not used in the rain so I hope it won’t leak. If it does I always have a backup. I was surprised it went back into the bag on first attempt. Others have said that the bag was too small. Folded correctly and rolled tight with the poles inside and the air pushed out it fits with room to spare. Can’t wait to use it again.', ""I live and buy by Amazon reviews so I definitely wanted to review this tent.\nFirst of all, it's huge! It can fit nine people but there were just two of us in there. We had a queen sized air mattress and our bags and still had a ton of space. We had the bed running towards the center from the far end of the tent and had space on each side to walk.\nSecond, it's tall in the middle so grown people can stand up fully. I'm not used to that. Getting dressed is so easy when you can stand up! It feels like the Taj Mahal when you're laying in bed and looking around.\nThird, it is fairly easy to set up. My son helped us with this and it was easy with three people, but could be done easily with two. The poles are quite long so extra hands are good. We had the rain fly slightly askew, though. User error.\nWe did get a slight tear at the seam near the area where the pole comes out near the bottom. Unsure what caused it but our tie dye duct tape, also from Amazon, came in handy.\nVentilation is fabulous when you have the screens on and the door flaps open. Plus, it has a great vent at the bottom that you can stake out for more venting.\nThe only issue I could see is if you are limited with available space where you are putting up the tent because it is quite large.\nI truly love this tent and am very happy with our choice.""]","[[['POSITIVE', 0.9972931742668152]], [['POSITIVE', 0.9992465972900391]], [['NEGATIVE', 0.934870183467865]], [['NEGATIVE', 0.9770247936248779]], [['POSITIVE', 0.9870320558547974]], [['POSITIVE', 0.9997369647026062]], [['POSITIVE', 0.9977678060531616]], [['NEGATIVE', 0.994293212890625]], [['NEGATIVE', 0.9308220148086548]], [['POSITIVE', 0.9961622953414917]]]"

Great tent for tropical climates like here in Hawaii. I have taken it out two times: Once beach camping in North Shore, and the second camping mauka in Kaneohe. Then why only 4 stars? It has mostly to do with design shortfalls, and not build quality. So here are the pro\'s, con\'s, and meh\'s:\n\nPRO\'S\n\n• Visual appeal - You will get compliments. The tent just looks cool. My friends started referring to it as ""Darth Tent.""\n• Dark Room - This function does make a difference. It allows for deeper sleep, and makes you feel like a bear settling into a cave for a winter\'s hibernation.\n• Quality - Coleman does a good job. The tent held up perfectly in tropical winds and rain, along with staying comfortable in radiant sunlight conditions.\n• Size - For two adults, a queen size airbed, and a pair of dogs, the sleeping area fit us well, and the porch area serves as a nice bug catch, and gear storage area.\n• Fast Pitch - I would say ""Quicker Pitch."" Poles come pre-attached, so that knocks off a couple minutes erecting the tent and breaking it down. Nice that they have done away with inserting poles through sleeves that rip too.\n\nCON\'S\n\n• None - it\'s a good tent... However there are design elements that make it miss it\'s mark.\n\nMEH\'S\n\n• Screen Room Entrance - There is no stake point in the front center. This simple design flaw makes it annoying to unzip without having to hold down the base with your foot. This can become a sobriety balance test some nights. Quick tip, stake the bottom zippers to the ground.\n• Screen Room Water Resistance - Due to the pitch of the screen, and no zip up panels or rainfly overhang, it gets wet in rain. This essentially makes the area useless for things like gear storage or a pup patio in wet weather.\n• Front Door - The entrance only half opens. You essentially have what could be a two-panel door. However, only the right side opens. That reduces visibility and airflow for whoever sleeps on that side of the bed (Thanks babe). If Coleman only extended that zipper all the way across, or made it a two-door design, it would be perfect.\n• Back Window / Wall - This section of the tent is a screen. That makes it nice for airflow and star gazing with the rainfly off. However, with it on, the view is blocked completely, and you have no airflow control from inside the tent. Coleman should place a window here that can be zipped up, and a screened ceiling for clear night sky viewing.\n• Window Views - This is a trend I have noticed with Coleman tents. The windows are high off the ground, making it so you cannot see out of them while laying down unless you have a raised airbed (I do not). In addition, with the rainfly on this model, the overhang reduces visibility even more. I realize this is a darkroom tent, however I still camp to see the views. Coleman should make these items adjustable with bigger window panels and arched rainfly awnings.\n• Height - So close... I am 5\'9"", which is a typical height. At the top of the dome, the height would be perfect so I would not need to slouch. However, once you have a bed in there, you are relegated to the outer edges and required to stoop or crank your neck to the side like you are at the Roxberry. Just another inch or two in height on this tent would increase comfort immensely.\n• Rainfly - Neon green! Great for visibility, and unfortunately also attractive to bugs. Insects love this color for some reason, and flock to it (or is swarm the right word?). Coleman, chill with the 80\'s neon, and choose another non-insect attracting point on the spectrum.\n\nOverall, a good tent, but not a great one. Happy camping, and I hope this helps!', ""Took this tent to a camping festival (Nocturnal Wonderland) and it's now my favorite tent ever. I was skeptical about it being darker inside than others but my tent was cooler and darker inside than any other at the campground. I slept till 10am or even till noon one day while other campers struggled to sleep past 8-9am because their tents were too warm or bright that early. Everyone wanted to hang out at my tent and everyone kept asking where I got it. I set it up easily by myself in about 15 min, maybe less."", 'Great little tent...with a few modifications. The poles are impossible to tell apart unless you lay them fully extended side by side. So mark them with nail polish or paint. If you spend 5 minutes with a piece of cheap plastic and some binder clips you can cover the screen room in a rain storm. Clip the edge of the plastic to the rainfly and roll it up out of the way. If rain is expected, unroll a bit and clip to the front arch pole with some slack so you don\'t pull on the rain fly itself. You need large 2""-3"" binder clips to reach around the pole\'s diameter. Then spread out the plastic and attach it with medium or small binder clips to the existing ropes or the tent or spare pegs or anywhere else that makes sense. I think the people who are annoyed by the lack of privacy when the rainfly is off can fix that with a piece of cloth and a few clips. Or a folded up rainfly and a few clips. Use clips to attach something to cover the electric cord holes. I have never seen binder clips from an office supply store used by other campers. Take some with you next time and uses will pop up all over. The black ones seem to disappear when I drop them so I just ordered some pastel ones.', ""Just got back from weekend camping with wet weather and tent and screen porch were dry as can be. I put a light weight tarp over the screen porch using carabineers to connect tarp to tent and and old spare tent pole to form the arched doorway. A couple of round tent pegs held the pole in place and two guy ropes held it firm. If this little 77 year old lady can manage to wet proof the screen room, so can you. It's now the perfect tent for me..."", ""Fantastic little tent! Have used twice so far and it did not disappoint! (The dark room factor was a huge selling point for me - not exactly a morning person)\nFirst camping trip (2 adults) we were able to fit a queen air mattress and our few duffel bags, etc with plenty of room to spare. The screened room is great for muddy shoes, coolers or if you don't mind a tight fit you can squeeze 2 chairs in there to keep away from the bugs.\nSecond camping trip (2 adults) we fit 2 cots, 3 bags/packs each underneath and there was still a decent amount of space in between to maneuver and was able to zip closed with no issue. It rained the first night, but the tent stayed leak free and on our last 2 days the wind kicked up pretty good, but this little guy held up beautifully with no rips or tears. As with most (or I should say all) '4 person' tents, this will not fit 4 people - at least comfortably - but will fit 2 just fine with plenty of room.\nThis is a great tent for the price, Coleman for the win!"", 'I will start by saying that the design for this tent (I got the 4 person) is pretty good. It took about 15 minutes for 2 people to setup which isn\'t bad but not that great either, I believe the 6-person version is adverted as fast pitch while the 4 person is conventional. The screen room does a good job of keeping bugs and dirt out of the main tent although only the middle portion has a rain cover, the sides and front will get wet if it rains.\n\nNow for the reason I bought the tent, the ""DarkRoom"" Feature. Coleman advertises on their site that the ""he Dark Room™ technology on this tent blocks 97.5% of sunlight."" I find this to be extremely misleading. I believe that the darkroom material/coating does block nearly all sunlight however they only made the rain-fly and windows out of that material! The sides of the tent are made form normal tent material that lets in a lot of light. To me this tent is darker than a normal one but only slightly. If I would have known that the tent was not entirely made of the darkroom material I would not have bought it.\n\nRecap: It is a decent overall but I would not buy for the Darkroom feature. Coleman, please make a tent entirely out of this material!', 'We have taken this tent out twice since purchasing it. It proved worthy of my list of camping staples while setting it up. If you are weighing the pros and cons, consider the following:\nPRO:\n1. It is an incredibly easy and fast tent to pitch. There are hooks that snap onto the poles; the second camping trip we had it up (including rainfly) in 3-4 minutes.\n2. The porch area is PERFECT for dogs and gear... i have two large dogs... but i bet i could fit 2-3 more in the porch area.\n3. I\'m 5\'6"" and I can fully stand up in the center of the tent.\n4. Great ventilation if you want it, otherwise it does stay cooler inside that outside in desert environments (humidity is a different animal all together).\n5. Without the rainfly half of the back wall is completely mesh and helps move air around even if you have the door and windows closed.\n6. Fits two large dogs and a queen sized air mattress inside\n\nCONS:\n1. For some one used to lightweight everything, this 6 person tent weighs 19-20lbs... so it\'s definitely for car camping.\n2. That back wall mesh adds a draft that during the colder seasons might make your head cold if you align your sleeping pad/mattress along it - i recommend using the opposite side with the door.\n3. The bag it comes in is kind of flimsy (i\'m reaching to come up with a 3rd con).', ""Do you hate camping because no matter how hard you try you can't sleep well once the sun comes up? What's that? You do? Then buy this tent.\nI camp upwards of 20 times per year and the most annoying thing about camping for me is I can never get good sleep past sunrise. I bought this tent in hopes to solve that and it does just that. The first time I camped in it I slept sound until about 8 in the morning. It blocks out a lot of light and for that I love it.\n\nEdit: I wanted to revise my review to state that I cannot attest to how watertight this tent is. I live in Oregon and it rains quite heavily here for a better part of the year, therefore I've always used tarps. Some of the storms here are quite substantial so I've never been one to test my tent's capabilities when it comes to water."", 'This was our first Dark Room Technology Tent. Our previous tent was of similar design, but without the vestibule and the Dark Room Tech. Even on a cloudy morning, at sunrise it was so bright inside that it was difficult to sleep. The Coleman Dark Room Tech is a big improvement in reducing the amount of light in the tent. It is not ""pitch dark"" in the tent. There is still quite a bit of light to clearly see in a backpack or even read, but it is not so bright to prevent you from remaining asleep.\n\nThe entire back section is a screen window and the fly covers it and provides the darkness. While Coleman claims that the tent runs a few degrees cooler than conventional tents, I have no way of comparing it to my old tent. It may be a bit cooler inside, but to me it seemed to be more stuffy. I see the need for the fly to hug the tent and cover it lower to the ground, to block the light, but it also blocks some of the breeze that ventilates the tent.\n\nThe vestibule is really nice to have. We placed our coolers there out of the sun, and it provided a clean place to take off or put on your shoes. It rained a day or two, some rain blew into the vestibule and puddled on the floor, but I could sit there without getting soaked. The living area of the tent remained totally dry even through hard rain and high winds.\n\nThe instructions for assembling the tent consist of a set of simple drawings. They don’t show much detail, especially how the poles are oriented and attached to the tent by a tie at the top. During our first setup we noticed a piece of red tape on one of the pole ends and one of the plastic bottom receivers. That was our only indication that the poles were directional, as it is not indicated on the drawings. However, I must say that Coleman Customer Service is outstanding. I called them once before buying the tent and once after the first use for a defective strap. Both times they were friendly, helpful and very knowledgeable. They answered my questions and solved our warranty issue quickly and easily.\n\nAll said, we are very happy with our purchase of the Coleman Carlsbad Fast Pitch Cabin Tent with Dark Room Technology.', ' Absolutely in love with this tent!!!\n\nSize: the 6 person tent fit a queen size air mattress with several feet on either side. Very large inside. We are able to walk around in it easily. There are usually just 2 of us camping in it, but we still enjoy the size to be able to walk around, get changed, and stand up. Our previous 4 person tent did not allow for as much comfort.\n\nWeather proof: this tent was used during several thunderstorms and not a single drop of water got in. Very impressed with this\n\nDarkroom: absolutely amazing. The darkroom is the BEST part about this tent! It keeps the tent dark and cool in the morning. In our other tents, it would become extremely hot and bright by 6am. This tent allows you to sleep in just because you won’t be woken up right when the sun comes up (unless you open window). Love how dark and cool it remains throughout the day. I attached a photo of how dark it remains even at 2pm.\n\nSturdiness & setup: the tent seems to be made of high quality materials and we feel very confident in the integrity of the tent.

This tent will be a welcome addition to our gear collection! Due to COVID-19 quarantine, I had to try this tent out in the backyard, but I believe I learned the key features and what I like and do not like about this tent.\n\nPROS:\n- WOW! Super Easy setup! They said 5 minutes on the product description and that sounds about right. The poles are attached to the tent and simply clip into position. No threading poles through fabric sleeves, which I always struggle with! Very, very easy.\n- Since I tried it at home, I sprayed it down with water. It was water proof alright! The ‘bath tub flooring’ design, very common on tents these days, worked well and ensured no water got in at the bottom of the tent.\n- The floor of the tent is very durable. Usually I am telling the kids not to walk in tent with shoes on to avoid tearing it. Not this tent! (They should keep their muddy shoes outside anyway though!).\n- Actually fit back in the provided bag! I have had some tents that you have to roll so tight to get back in. The design of this bag is a little more “forgiving” and I was able to roll and stuff and zip and toss in trunk!\n- Roomy! The description says you can fit a queen size air mattress in there. Sounds about right. We threw a full sized airbed and 3 sleeping pads for the kids, and still had a little room. With no gear, could fit 6 full sized adults in there as advertised.\n- As two short adults, headroom is not a problem in most tents, but this did seem taller than others.\n\nCONS:\n- As a parent, I know kids break things, and that concerns me with the “built in” pole design. While it is awesome for a quick painless setup, I could see my kids pushing too hard to lock them, or just playing with the tent and snapping a pole. Then what? Not sure if the tent is trash at that point or repairable? I need to research that more with Coleman!\n- Heavy! Heavier than other 6 man tents I use. Not a huge deal but I store my gear on a loft in the garage and need to be aware when lifting this tent up or down that I will be a pound or so more than my last tent!\n\nIn summary - an awesome tent & so glad to have it! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!\n\n(PS - once I can take this out to a park and try it out away from home, I will revise this as needed!)', 'The 8 man tent is bigger than I thought. I’m almost 6ft and stood up to change in it. It’s not insulated so it’s not warm, invest in a buddy heater, or sleep system. I did sleep in the rain, freezing rain and snow with 15 mph winds and stayed dry. Be sure and tie down the rain fly sides to a stake or tarp.', 'Decided to post my first-ever review here on Bezos, Inc. because I was so impressed with this tent.\n\nI recently replaced an aging high-dollar tent with this(4-person size). Went with cheap-ish since I’ll likely only be using it for car camping until I get a camper. Set it up for a backyard camp out; the tent went up fairly easily. The stakes are garbage; I bent one putting it into a grass lawn.\n\nThe reason for the 5 stars is that it started raining the morning after the camp out, and didn’t stop for two days. Not wanting to put away a wet tent, I left it up until we got some sun. Everything in the tent was bone dry after two full days of steady and at times heavy rain. Not bad for a $100 tent. 10/10 would recommend.', ""Just did a little backyard camp out and it was pretty easy to set up. I'm not a camper and have never owned a tent, much less set one up. But I got this figured out without much trouble. Not the most fantastic air flow if you have the rain cover on, but it was ridiculously hot and humid outside so it's probably not a fair assessment.\n\nTent is very roomy. I'm over six feet tall and it wasn't hard for me to move around inside or sleep in it. Instructions for setup are good. They should point out in the tear down that when you roll it up, you need to fold over the little extra bit of fabric that is longer than the tent poles to get everything to the right width so it will fit in the carrying bag. Not a big deal, just something to save you from rerolling it. The whole thing is quite small when packed away for storage."", 'Used it for the first time this weekend. It was easy to set up and put away. Surprisingly spaceous!', ""It's good quality. Doesn't get hotter than any other tent, I do enjoy the lower screen sides. It's has been set up during two rainy days and not a drop has made it inside, of course if your stuff is pressed against the sides it will probably get wet though. This was super easy to set up with one or two people, I didn't even look at the instructions. Take down is as easy as any other Coleman tent. My favorite is the preattached poles and the fact that there is no little sleeve to thread the poles through. Just put the poles together, attach them to the correct corners and hook the tent to the poles. The only downside is I had a hard time finding the front of the rain fly the first couple times. I would recommend getting at least one size bigger that what you need, just for some extra moving space. Overall it's great tent for a new camper or a seasoned camping vet and I would definitely recommend it."", 'Poles are connected to the tent, so if one breaks, you need to buy an entirely new tent. Not enough material, stitching seems like it will break at some point because the amount of strain on each clip, you REALLY have to pull and stretch them. Also, does not fit in the carrying bag you get. Cheap design by a company trying to maximize profit. Provided a little more fabric, like 1/4"" or less around and you wouldn\'t have to worry about the seams being on the verge of tearing. Tent fly design totally sucks and is not easy to put on, either. WAY TOO complicated. What is wrong with some elastic cord with plastic hooks that hook on to loops built on the tent rather than this crap design? Would set up much quicker and be less hassle. I would give a zero if I could. For such a popular brand, you would think they could do a better job. Do not recommend this tent.', 'the color was so much cuter than expected- had some lighter minty tones! interesting how the poles are attached to the tent itself and don’t require you to feed them through any fabric on the tent- they just snap on with clips! i set it up with another person, but as a new camper i am curious to see how easy it would be to set up solo. the shape of this has such better space than other two person tents i’ve seen. i’m glad i returned the generic one i bought off of amazon for this coleman’s name brand.', 'There are only three of us in our family, but we bought the 8 person version of this tent so we would have plenty of floor space and headroom. I’m about 5’ 11” and can stand in the middle. We can fit a queen size and a twin size air mattress i here and still have plenty of room. Easy to set up, but really need two people to set it up easily.', ""This is our second coleman tent and we were really pleased with the size and quality on our first camping trip using it. We previously had the Rosewood 4 person tent which was tight for 2 tall adults. This 8 person tent was more than enough space for our queen mattress, multiple bags and to stand up and move around comfortable. Couldn't have been more pleased with the size and height. The assembly took a little longer than I thought but that was primarily due to the size and not the difficulty or part. Just takes a little longer when there are 2 of you but it took about 10 minutes total. I liked that it came with the small mat for the door so you don't have to track anything inside the tent. My only complaint- the zipper for the door gets caught on the little zipper flap.

It held great during the rain and wind, it was light and breezy during the warm night, but not insulated at all for the cold night. So prepare accordingly. I also did not place the rain fly correctly, might have been my fault it was so cold at night, but I swear it was coming from the bottom.

(not really a 'con', just different)\n- NOT a two-person tent if either one has any gear beyond a sleeping bag. There's only room for one with additional stuff.\n\nWould I recommend this tent?

Then I got this cheap tent for my friend\'s birthday along with a sleeping bag and man this tent is awesome. It\'s WAY smaller than my ""portable"" expensive tent, it packs quicker and it works just as well! It even has a hole for a power cable to sneak in some electronics. Just add some water sealant on the seams and a tarp on the bottom and you\'re set. This tent makes me angry because my friend is doing better than me for 1/6th the price lol.

You can leave it in the car with minimum space.\nThe space was perfect for our family of four, two adults and two kids.

I am not adept in camping but i think that amount of time to setup is a great thing.', 'Got this as a birthday gift for my daughter. My hubs & I, two non-campers, were able to put this together easily! It’s pretty much everything you would want. When pegged down it seems like it would last in a storm. There are plenty of zips and airflow spaces, there’s even a place to run an electric line into the tent. The only con I can see is the zippers are not super reinforced, they’re just lightweight zippers and looks like they might be able to be broken easily if not used with care. But just take care when zipping and you should be fine! I do wish the ties on top or longer so that you can use better knots or even a bow to secure, but they’re very short. I would look to extending those somehow by sewing on extra length or something if I were to keep this tent myself. Fabric is good; It’s not necessarily the most sturdy of material, it’s pretty much just a medium weight nylon, but it seems sturdy enough. I would suggest an under pad for the bottom because it doesn’t seem very thick and you would want to use this great tent many times!', ""It is very lightweight, small, and has just enough space to fit 2 people with sleeping pads (although you will have much more room if you use it alone). Easy to assemble by yourself in under 10 minutes and served its purpose for camping outside. This was my tent while hiking in the west in places like Zion and Yosemite and it was able to handle wind and moderate rain without any leaks.\n\nThe reason it is not 5 stars is because the stakes that come with the tent are garbage. If you buy this tent, stop by walmart to buy stronger, hooked steel stakes that can take a beating. The aluminium stakes this tent came with bent with each strike and I ended up throwing them all way. The last thing you want while camping is to have to throw away the foundation for your tent.\n\nSeveral reviews stated that their poles broke so I always kept this in mind when setting up my tent. Although my poles never broke, the elastic string inside the poles that holds them ended up breaking. I was still able to make them work but keep in mind that even if you're careful stuff will break.\n\nAlso the zipper on the bag that the tent stows away in broke which was a bit inconvenient.\n\n2 month edit: Setting this up during a heavy rain was not a pleasant experience. Because the rainfly is attached after propping up the tent, water was able to get into the tent during the setup. It was late, so I had neither the time or patience to dry the inside of my tent and had to sleep with a wet interior. Im thankful, it was not freezing or things could have been a lot worse. Use this tent during good weather or set it up well in advance of light-moderate rainfall.

Was upset at current pricing of REI Half Dome 4, which I have used my entire life for car camping. Settled on the Lynx after reading 500 reviews and determining it was the best of the ALPS 4-person line. Ordered a cheap $15 WOLFWILL 94"" x 86"" Waterproof Camping Tarp instead of the $40+ ALPS footprint. Risky but I like playing with fire.\n\nTook tent to remote West Virginia forest with skeptical city-dwelling woman. Also risky move, but ALPS was ready for this challenge. Thunderstorms moved in and unleashed back-to-back all night deluges worthy of a passage in Revelations.

Seems very well made. Never pitched a freestanding before and it took me all of 15 minutes. Really gusty wind didn't help. Very stable once up and staked and guy lined. Like all the features. For the money if it lasts 2 or 3 seasons of hard use then i will be satisfied. After reading some of the reviews i added a piece of para cord to each rain fly zipper. If the ground is wet or muddy at the bottom of the flap finding and pulling the little string on the zipper could be a pain. I also added about 6 inches of cord to the rain fly's bottom center loops in order to stake it away from the floor. Looks like almost zero rain will reach the tent itself now. This a 4 person so its plenty roomy for the wife and I and our two pups. We are expecting severe rain and wind tonight and tomorrow. I will update this review afterwards\n\n**Update**\nThe tent was up for four days. Heavy winds 20-30 with higher gusts and 2 inches of hard blowing rain testerday. This morning there were two small puddles near the door about the size of melted ice cubes. Awesome performance. I did upgrade the guy ropes to para card and staked it down really well but for under $120 cant beat it. The tent as it came int the bag weighs 8 lbs 11 oz on my postal scale. I added a .6mil poly ground sheet With grommets I made for about $6. The photo shows tent, stakes (texasport), ground aheet and an extra tarp.\nThis could be packed in a few miles for a few nights with no problem."", ""This past spring we put this tent through the wringer. We backpack as a family and my kids don't like sleeping apart from us, so I went with a 4 person tent instead of a couple smaller ones.\nCons:\n-Weight. This is heavy. The complete kit is almost 10lbs by my scale, but we split it by tent, poles, and fly between my boys, my girl, and I so it comes out to about what a heavier hiking tent would be per person.\n-Small vestibules. For a car camping sized tent, you figure the vestibules would be big enough to put your shoes on in. Nope. But this is a lightweight hiking tent for, so I'm not docking a star because I don't expect a lodge.\n\nPros:\n-Incredibly waterproof. The first two days we had a constant and miserable rain. The rainfly soaked in about an hour and I thought we were in trouble. Then we just werent. It finally dripped on the third days when I touched the tent. I didnt know that would cause water to start wicking through, but it dripped a few times an hour for the next two days. Not docking a star because 1) your not supposed to touch a wet tent or it will drip where you touched and 2) on the night of day 3 heavy stormed rolled in and drenched us for the next two days. It got very humid with us packed in there, till I opened the handy vents.\n-The Handy Venty. These things are awesome. There are two vents in the rain fly. You do have to open them from the outside, which sucks in the rain, but most just dont have these...especially in the lightweight tents.\n-Tough. The night of day 3 we packed up most of camp, walked out, and went to a hotel to avoid a tornado warning. I can do storms, but I prefer to not be a kite. I wanted to see what it could do, so I ticketed the guys a little and left it there. When we came back the next morning there were fallen limbs everywhere, but the Lynx was still right where I left it, with the only water inside contained by the towel we left to catch the drip. Not bad at all.\n\nBuy this tent."", ""I love this tent. It's sturdy and the rain flap goes all the way to the ground to keep rain out, even in windy conditions. I use it when I deploy to fires, so I sleep in the tent for 14 to 21 days at a stretch. I just got back from a 14-day deployment using the Lynx 4 and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. Before this one, I bought a Colman. It seemed like a nice tent until we had an out-flow wind event and the fiberglass rods splintered. I posted the attached picture on social media and told my friends that my poor little tent had gotten so scared, it fell down and died. I highly recommend the ALPS Mountaineering Lynx 4 Tent."", 'I had a good experience with this tent, it was a good upgrade from my old one. I use this for car camping, I would never use it for backpacking, but it is super light for what it is (so light in fact, I thought it was missing poles or something lol). It is a ""4"" person tent, however my wife and I use it as a 2 person and put a queen size air mattress inside. I wouldn\'t try to sleep 4 in this unless you were on mats, stacked very close.\n\nPros: Easy to set up with 2 people. Poles snap in instead of the old push-thru sleeve design, and I like that. The tent fly design is interesting as well, it keeps the water away from the tent body unlike others. All the seams were well sewn, really happy with that. The tent is also lightweight, not backpacking lightweight, but definitely lighter than what I\'m used to in this size of tent. The tent is very well protected with the fly on. Decent size, fits a queen size air mattress with about a foot on either side and about 10"" on top and bottom.\n\nCons: Stakes were very lightweight aluminum, not really hearty enough for my tastes. Replaced with larger steel stakes. The design of the fly allows for great protection, but poor ventilation. This can be a fair trade-off in my opinion depending on the circumstances, take it as you will. The fly zipper when zipped is all the way at the ground, a few feet away from the tent body. It\'\'s difficult to get to when inside the tent, however tying a little 2 foot piece of string to it fixes that. No windows with the fly on, but the fly does offer excellent protection.\n\nOverall I was very happy with the tent, it seems to be built well. Buy some better stakes right away, but if you\'re looking for a good car camping tent, this is a good choice.', ""This tent replaced my previous 4-person Ozark and what a difference! First off, this tent is much larger than expected. With a standard size sleeping bag, sleeping pad, large hiking pack and misc things, there's still enough room for a small table and chair inside.The poles, clips, and zippers are great quality. Easy solo set up took about 8 minutes with rain fly and stakes. The vestibules are nice but can be a little tricky to unzip from the inside due to the Velcro section at the base of the zipper... had to use the finger hook technique to separate. Now that I know, it shouldn't be an issue. I have only used once so far and very impressed. Looking forward to more trips out and aero-camping. Maybe later down the road, I will invest in the 1-person lynx for my quick spontaneous weekend adventures since the 4-person is a bit overkill for one... but comfortable for two!"", 'I used this tent for the first time for 3 nights in Tillamook Oregon over the past weekend (10/7-10/10). Tillamook is on the coast so the conditions were very sandy, windy, and rainy. The tent stakes were no match for the soft damp sand and wind so I opted to purchase some more heavy duty stakes (10inch nail stakes) which worked perfectly. The tent was very easy to set up for 2 people. Only complaint is that the tent comes with only 4 guy lines, therefore nor enough to tie down the middle sections of the rain fly (I always carry extra rope, so it wasn\'t a big deal). The door is slightly annoying to get in/out of (I\'m 5\'8"") with the rain fly down (which is a must in rainy conditions) but totally worth having dry shoes..I had 3 pairs (mine and daughters) under the rain fly. The best thing about this tent is how it held up under severely rainy and windy conditions. There were severe weather warnings and we averaged about 3/4 an inch of rain each night. So much rain (welcome to Oregon)! The tent stayed bone dry up until about dawn of the third night when I got a slight amount of wetness coming down from the top of the tent. I did not waterproof the tent before use so all waterproofing was from the manufacturer. I was so happy! With all the mesh it was a little cool at night (it got down to about mid 40s at night). As far as size, I was able to fit a standard queen size mattress plus 2 smallish bags with plenty of room to spare. I would say 2 adults and 1 small child or 1 adult and 2 children would fit comfortably in this tent.\nAll in all, I love the tent and even got a lot of compliments from my camping mates (who were jealous that my rain fly completely covered my tent).', 'Of all the tents I\'ve owned, this is the best combination of price, quality, weight, and features I have found.\n\nMy wife and I set it up the first time in less than 10 minutes without the instructions. It\'s very intuitive and the pole clips vs. sleeve is ingenious, fast and easy. Set-up and break-down is a breeze for two people, but is a bit of a challenge for one. The package includes guy lines and stakes, as well as a removable gear loft that easily holds my solar flashlight for interior lighting.\n\nMy wife is 5\'-4"" and I am 6\'-2"", and we both found the interior spacious for 2 people and gear, with room to move around easily, even with air mattresses and sleeping bags deployed. There is plenty of circulation and the interior remained reasonably comfortable in the tropical heat. The two vestibules are large enough to leave cooking gear, shoes and dirty clothes outside while still protected.\n\nThere are only 2 stash pockets and I would have liked a couple more, but I understand the trade-offs to hit the sweet spot of price v. features. The spikes are a little flimsy and won\'t hold up to a lot of hammering. I added 2 - 60d steel spikes for the vestibules. The straps on the tent bag are a bit of a hassle when trying to stuff everything back in.\n\nAll the materials feel sturdy and the stitching is top notch and strong. The bucket is fairly deep and if water gets over the top, you have a lot more problems than keeping dry. At roughly 8lbs., with a pack that\'s already 45lbs., it\'s a workout to carry uphill You\'ll want to keep this in mind when divvying up the gear for a long hike. Weight and durability are the constant struggle for backwoods adventures.\n\nAll around great product with an excellent price. shipping to Indonesia was lightning fast, arriving 2 weeks before promised.', 'Have been camping all my life ( 40+years) and have had a multitude of tents. The Lynx is light, packs small ( for what it is), comes with everything you need, is easy to setup and teardown, handles storms with ease, and ventilates without comparison. There is also plenty of room for me 6\'2"", my 2 kids, and dog to sleep comfortably.\n\nI have camped in it for the past 3 years and have been out at least 25 times. In the rain, in the freezing cold and in the sweltering heat of a southern summer and it had held strong every time. I am really amazed with how well it ventilates with the rainfly attached. This is due to the pole design and space created between the fly and the tent when properly attached.\n\nSetup is easy due to pole clips versus sleeves. I LOVE this. The tent fabric actually hands below the poles and the fly sits on top of the poles. You do need to tie off the sides of the fly to keep that space consistent down the sides and open the fly vents ( which no rain has ever entered) and enjoy yourself.\n\nI bought a tarp to use as a footprint like another reviewer to save the bottom of the tent and create space between the tent bottom and the wet ground.\n\nThanks for a great product!', ""I highly recommend this tent. I was looking for a moderate priced 4 person tent for a trip to the Bounderey Waters Wilderness Canoe Area. Easy to set up. It rained 3 of the 5 nights, and we never once got wet. Plenty of room for 2 people and most of your gear. The 2 vestibules were great for keeping wet boots and gear out of the tent. We learned that even on cold nights you still need to open the vents on the rainfly. You will have a lot of condensation on the inside of the tent in the morning if you don't. I got heavy tent stakes to use instead of the supplied stakes. We stayed in it 4 more nights after we left the canoe trip and never had any problems whatsoever. Later in the summer we took a family trip with 3 tents to a nearby river to go floating. That night it rained 2 inches. This Alps tent is the only one of the 3 that didn't leak. The rest of us in the other tents got soaked. Highly recommend this tent.\nUpdate October 2019\nThis tent has been used too many times to count since my original review. It has been to the Buffalo River in Arkansas spring and fall of each year at least twice in each season, and has been to Colorado for 8 nights, and I still love and highly recommend this tent. It is $40 higher now than when I bought mine, but still think it is worth it.""]","[[['NEGATIVE', 0.9986099004745483]], [['NEGATIVE', 0.9791146516799927]], [['NEGATIVE', 0.9966717958450317]], [['NEGATIVE', 0.9737215042114258]], [['POSITIVE', 0.992770254611969]], [['POSITIVE', 0.9854706525802612]], [['NEGATIVE', 0.6445026397705078]], [['POSITIVE', 0.9631871581077576]], [['POSITIVE', 0.9972860813140869]], [['POSITIVE', 0.9986900687217712]]]"

I spent months looking at tents online and reading reviews before finally deciding to buy this one. Why this one? Because the brand with the biggest tents (IYKYK) has so many mixed reviews on waterproofing and durability, so I was worried about spending $300-500 on a tent that may or may not work. I have always used Coleman tents and have yet to have any issues. So I took a chance on this one, hoping the brand was still up to par. I either got lucky, or they remain one of the best brands.\n\nI set this up over a weekend, on a day when it was slightly windy, maybe 10mph breezes. So there was a little challenge with keeping things where I needed them until I was staked down, but the tent itself is heavy enough that it didn't budge. Only my tarps and the fly had issue with the wind. Regardless, I got it about 90% put together myself, and then needed help from one other person to raise it and get the first couple poles in place before I could finish the rest by myself. I don't know if I could have gotten it up without ANY help, but maybe if I did it a certain way...who knows. The fly definitely needed a second person to help pull it over the top, but I also waited until I had the whole tent up to deal with the fly. I staked the whole thing down, and then staked the guy lines. All of them.\n\nThe second night the tent was up, we had rain. The next morning when I went out and checked, there wasn't a single drop on the inside, while the entire outside had water beaded up all over it. I left the tent up for something like a week and a half, and during that time, we had two or three storms roll through with a ton of rain and winds. The tent held up to all of it, still not a single drop inside, on the walls or the floor, and the winds didn't break anything. I am super impressed with the performance of this tent under those conditions, and I will certainly trust it on a camping trip after all that. I ended up taking it down on an evening when it was already pretty windy and calling for even worse winds and storms. I didn't want to push my luck. Although the already fierce wind gust were pushing the sides of the tent around, the poles and guy lines weren't budging one bit. That's testament to why those guy lines are SO important, in addition to staking the tent itself.\n\nMy only possible complaint is that this tent is pretty difficult to pack in a way that can fit everything back into the tote bag. Yes, I was rushing and dealing with winds, but I only managed to get the tent and fly back into the bag. I have the poles in their own bag, outside of the tote. I did also have to tear the seam on the bottom of the tote, which gives it some extra play for stuffing the tent in. But even still, I couldn't fit the poles in with it. I may try to unpack it and see if I can pack it more neatly, but it's not the end of the world, for sure. It's not a big enough complaint to lower my overall rating.\n\nOh, and I had a king-sized air mattress set up in there...I had it on the back end of the tent, there was space on both sides to walk around the bed, AND it only took up half the tent, lengthwise. Plus you get the extra space in the front screen room, which can be either completely open view, partially open view, or completely closed off as a second private area. The fly is even designed to roll up on the front sides, so you can have it even more open for airflow. This thing is just huge and roomy. I can't wait to get it out and do some real camping with it!"", 'Very nice tent, very easy to put up with two people, seem to be well constructed and I have had no problems with the material, just make sure before you put any waterproofing spray on your tent you read the instructions well because if you do not let it dry 100% before you pack it up to store it could cause issues with the material. Also did not put any waterproofing spray on the screen Windows and screen doors.', 'First time out with, we underwent a huge rain storm with high winds. The tent stayed completing standing, ZERO water entered the tent. Fairly easy to assemble, two people makes in much easier. However, getting it all to fit back in the bag was a challenge.

It\'s very light, easy to set up and easy to pack away. I had originally purchased the 2p version. I was immediately impressed how quickly it went up. It even fit my 18"" twin air mattress with room by the front opening for my gear but it was tight. I opted to get the 4p and not only is it bigger but it has some better features.\nThe 4p tent went up just as easily with one person doing the work. I did lay a tarp underneath because it\'s a thinner floor but exactly what you will get in this price point. I like that the top is well ventilated with mesh so if I don\'t need the rain fly, I can look at the stars. There are large front and back windows, a built in mesh sack on either side for small items, a hook for my lantern or tent fan and a small zippered opening to allow an electrical cord to pass through.\nUsing the same mattress from before, it now did not press against the sides of tent and I had plenty of room for my stuff and more to store items when it rained (chairs, camp stove, etc...). This size mattress is overkill but it\'s all I had at the time and I didn\'t want to buy another just yet. This tent should easily accommodate a queen sized 10"" air mattress and 2 people would be fine in this. I would not say this is a 4p tent unless they are smaller people and willing to be packed in a bit. I like to leave room for gear but that\'s just me.\nI did Scotchguard the rain fly before I left for my trip. We encountered heavy rains for one day and the tent stayed dry. No clue whether that was good stitching or the Scotchguard but I was happy.\nOne of my favorites things? It\'s very easy to pack away. The bag is large enough and the tent and pulled do not have to be forced back in. The 2p bag was way too small.\n*update * 7/25/21- I have used this tent 3x for a total of 10 days with no issues.

We used it for all of our camping trips last year and once so far in 2018 so I felt like its gotten enough use at this point that I could leave a review that might be helpful. We are using this tent for two adults, one toddler, and two medium sized dogs. The tent is advertised as a 6 person tent but I think 4 adults would be the most that would fit comfortably. For us I think its the perfect size for our family, we usually put our inflatable queen sized  Coleman Quickbed Plus Airbed With 4D Pump Twin, Full, Queen and King  mattress with the sleeping bags on one side and set up the  Coleman 2000020279 Compact Folding Table  and two Coleman Camping Chairs on the other side so we have a place to eat or do card games inside. The tent has two closable windows in the front and one on each side. The window in the back is mesh only for the top half of that side and does not have a cover to zip it closed, so if you do not have the rain flap on the back part of the tent is almost completely open (with the rain flap on its completely covered).\n\nI had debated on whether or not to get a tent with a screen room and I\'m glad we did. The screen room on this particular model is not huge and the angle it connects to the main tent dome at does not leave much head room, but it does give you a nice area to take shoes off and gives you the option to leave the tent door itself open to get more airflow. We also use this area to keep our cooler and as a place to keep the dog food/water (during the day). The two complaints I have about the screen room (which changed my overall rating from 5 stars = I love it to 4 stars = I like it) is #1 there are 6"" openings at the bottom of the area where the screen room connects to the main tent, as others have noticed there should be a way to close these openings because they allow bugs and critters to crawl into the screen room and #2 the mesh on the screen room goes all the way to the ground so when it rains mud ends up coming inside, this could have been prevented by having the waterproof bottom go up the same height as it does around the main tent portion.\n\nAs for construction/durability, I think Coleman is a reputable brand and I\'ve always found their tents to be quite durable, this tent is no different. We have not yet used the tent in extreme weather (heavy rain or wind), so I do not know how it would hold up in either, but this tent has held up perfectly to the abuse from my toddler as well as the constant opening/closing doors, windows, etc. I have absolutely no complaints about its durability. I would recommend this tent.', 'I initially was going to leave a 4 star review because we thought the tent didn’t come with any stakes but to our surprise, after going to Dicks to buy some we found the original stakes. To my knowledge its better to have some spares anyway. So now we know they come with the tent, Ive updated my review to 5 stars! Setup was a breeze. We truthfully struggled with the rainfly but now that we’ve set everything up, I’m sure when we go camping it wont take nearly as long. I have no complaints with this purchase. Everything came as described. Very spacious considering im 6’2 and can stand vertically in the center without kneeling down. I’m very pleased. Will definitely recommend this product to others!', ""We recently took our first family camping trip as a family of 4 with 2 young boys and a dog (4 and 7 months). I have camped and hiked a good bit, and was familiar with higher end backpacking tents, but not large family car camping tents. After doing a lot of research, and weighing spending $500 on a high end tent vs. ~$100 on big box store tents we decided to go with the Coleman Steel Creek 6. The big selling points were, price, the screen room that we can let the boys play in without getting eaten alive by bugs, and the large but not oversized tent body. I was a little cautious as I did not have a high opinion of Coleman gear.\n\nThe tent goes up so easy, and with 2 people it takes less than 10 min to put up. Upon initial set up, I loved the functional layout of the tent. The tent was large enough to fit a full size air mattress, a childs sized sleeping pad, and a pack-n-play for a little one with tons of room to spare. The screen room was perfect as a play area for our boys during the day, and our dog's favorite place to sleep at night. My two concerns about the tent were the somewhat flimsy fiber glass poles, and whether or not the tent was water proof. On our final night we had an unexpected rain storm, where it came down pretty hard for about and hour. The inside of the tent was bone dry, so no worries there. Time will tell if the fiberglass poles hold up.\n\nThe only down side as others have mentioned was dirt and mud did wash into the screen room. It would be so much better if Coleman used a bath tub design here as well as this was a mess in the morning. It was not horrible but it did make a mess, I will need to see what I can come up with for this."", 'I was on the hunt for a tent that felt like a house, and I found it! This tent offers a lot of space, is easy to build, and feels homey. Assembling it took us about 15 minutes if that. I would say you need 2 people to build but was very upfront and easy. We turned our “front porch” into our kitchen and kept the cooler and a chair in their. It was a lot of fun at night to sit in there and watch the lightning bugs. Our first night camping a rather large thunderstorm happened. It was scary but the tent held up without any issues. Other sites tents were blowing away and people were leaving while we were sitting watching them from our window. We have a queen size mattress and there was still a bunch of room. Our plan is to buy two chairs and a table for in the tent so next time we can sit and read or play cards. The only issue we had was bugs. They all would get stuck between the top roof and the tent and we could hear them at night time. But you are camping and bugs are excepted. Overall it’s a really nice tent, I slept really well, and would recommend you to buy it.', 'I can count on one hand how many times I\'ve been camping in my lifetime and I\'m now 61 yrs old. But after moving to Oregon 3 yrs ago, we discovered so many places we wanted to visit/spend time/fish and hotels are either too far away or too spendy. So camping. After looking at several tents, I decided upon the 6-person Steel Creek tent. I noticed a lot of reviews were critical of the screen room not being waterproof, and rain is not a seasonal thing in the Pac NW, but I figured the 6-person tent would be large enough for my adult daughter and myself + all our stuff if need be.\n\nFirst setup (test before our big trip) was less than perfect. We attached the tent clips to the poles before inserting the pole ends in the receptacle cups for those at the corners of the tent. Later, I searched and found some YouTube videos that helped a lot. Second time (at our campsite), we assembled the poles and inserted the pole ends in the receptacle cups first, then attached tent clips to the poles. This tent is TALL and we\'re not, so it was a bit tricky attaching the highest clips and tying the fabric strip to the pole frame at the very top. We accomplished this by unzipping the screen room and tent doors and stepping nearer the center of the tent. Next time, we\'ll probably tie the tie before inserting pole ends in the receptacle cups and bring a super collapsible step stool to address the vertical challenge.\n\nRainfly. After some confusion about the front/back of the rainfly during first setup, I marked the corners of the front with a sharpie pen, but it really wasn\'t necessary. The front has a 5"" wide piece of fabric attached to it, draping over/attaching to the screen room pole.\n\nStakes. The stakes that came with the tent are really a checkbox (yeah, we include stakes). When I bought the tent, I also bought the Coleman accessory kit (the rubber mallet, stake puller, heavy duty stakes were really helpful). Those stakes are good, but the YouTube videos about guy lines also taught me about the lightweight aluminum tri-beam stakes. I found them at a nearby equipment store and wished I\'d bought more than 4. I\'d used the Coleman heavy duty stakes for the corners of the tent, and the tri-beams for everywhere else.\n\nGuy lines. The rainfly comes with guy lines attached. I like that they are white and have reflective strips woven in and they were great for night visibility. They also have line tighteners attached for making the lines taut after they are attached to stakes, but the reflective material prevents the guy lines from sliding, so tightening took a little bit more work. Even so, I don\'t think a taut line knot would have slid any easier (TY, YouTube for teaching me about guy lines and knots).\n\nFootprint. Prior to laying out the tent, we laid down a footprint (Columbia makes one that is 9\'10"" x 8\'10"" - perfect for this tent and a true footprint with web loops that join tent stakes at corners). The tent does have a thick tarp-like floor, but it was in breaking camp that we discovered the true value of the footprint. The underside of the tent floor was clean, despite setting it up on dead, damp pine needles and other detritus. The footprint was easy to flip over, sweep off, shake out. Another YouTube video explained why I wanted a footprint slightly smaller than the tent - it doesn\'t create a catch basin for rainwater between footprint and tent.\n\nBreaking camp. As I mentioned before, the footprint kept the tent floor clean. But the rain, breeze, a bird, and damp ground messed the rainfly and underside of the screen room floor. We live in an apartment so I really don\'t have a place to spread it all out for cleaning after we got home. And I didn\'t want to take seeds and bugs to another area where they might be invasive species. So we took a little extra time to sweep off, shake out, wipe down the rainfly. We unstaked the screen room first, then folded it back onto the collapsed tent and swept it off toward the bare ground.\n\nPacking it all back in the bag. I love the expandable bag feature and had already cut that seam, but the bottom side-to-side seam kept the bag from becoming a fully 4-5"" taller. I found that the rainfly, folded to a shorter length than the bag, fits nicely in the bottom, then the tent... I folded the 10\' wide width so that the front corners met in the middle, making a strip 5\' wide by 9\' long; then folded again in the same direction, so the tent was a 2.5\' wide strip, 9\' long. The 9\' length, folded in half, then in half again, then in half again, it fit perfectly.\n\nRain. Yes, it rained. Early June. Oregon Coast. The rainfly, properly staked with guylines, kept us dry. The rainfly also provides a 3\' roof over the screen room, leaving just a couple of feet exposed. After a night of gentle, all night long rain, there were a couple of small (4""?) puddles near the front of the screen room - easily sopped up with 3-4 paper towels.\n\nThe 6-person is perhaps too large for 2 people (twin air mattresses on opposite sides left 4\' between us), but I really wanted the additional height. Both my 4\'10"" daughter and I (5\'3"") can stand up and move around in this tent. Our first trip was only 4 days long, but we could comfortably spend a week or two. I also wanted the screen room so that if we found ourselves camping with gnats and mosquitoes, we could kick back in comfort. I found the Coleman Utopia Breeze Beach Chairs fit perfectly and gave us plenty of headroom.\n\nIs this the tent for hardcore campers who are planning a cross-country roadtrip? It is easy to set up, take down and pack. It easily withstood hours long rain showers and a breeze (less than 7 mph in a valley campsite, shielded by nearby hills), but it really is a fairweather tent. The back window doesn\'t have a covering (the rainfly provides privacy, but wouldn\'t prevent a cold wind from cooling the interior).', ""Bought this tent to use for two adults and 4 dogs! It worked as well as I thought it would. We had all the dogs and a queen sized air mattress in it and there was still room to move around. To be fair, we have 3 little dogs and one medium-large one. We bought it specifically for the screened in front porch, as we thought it'd be a great way to keep the pups in, but could still watch what we were doing - which it did! We also had lots of mosquitoes where we were and we ended up taking our chairs and table into the screened area so we could continue our card game and not be bitten. It worked great too!\n\nThe only complaint and it's not really a complaint, is just what others had mentioned, so I knew what to expect when buying it, and that was the 5 inch slits in the two corners, where the screened porch connects to the regular tent. They're meant for electric cords of course but they have the same slits going from the porch into the tent and those actually have zippers on them so you can close it up and keep bugs and snakes out but how do you keep them out of the porch? Well, I took Gorilla Glue Masking Tape and taped them shut. It'd be great if Coleman could take this advise and make the changes."", 'As I\'m sure you are aware, the photo in the description is not the correct one. However, you will get the Steel Creek 6 Person Fast Pitch Dome Tent with Screen. Order arrived timely and fine. Set up was easy. 2 things to note... there are 2 slits about 5 inches long, left open between the tent and screen room on both sides of the tent, to allow an electric cord to pass through. To bad these don\'t have zippers on them to close them. We are traveling to the southwest and I will reluctantly be putting duct tape on them to make sure scorpions and other critters don\'t get in. This way we will be able to leave the inside door open for better air circulation in the summer heat. The e-port for the tent does have a zipper, so that is very nice. Additionally I have found that the zippers in the door of the screen room don\'t stay shut. That may be because of how we\'ve pitched the tent, I don\'t know. (We will know better the next time we pitch it. UPDATED: It does depend on how you pitch it. All you have to do is loosen the ties at the top of the door and the zippers will stay together.) Again, it makes a possible entrance point for unwanted critters. I will make sure they are closed... and maybe put something in front of it to cover the ""hole"" during the night.\n\nWe pitched the tent in our yard yesterday in about 10-15 minutes. I knew that we were in for some heavy rain and thunderstorms during the night. I just checked how it did without any extra waterproofing... As expected the screen room floor was wet but even though I had left all the windows open (to check out the awnings,) the sleeping area was COMPLETELY dry. I really like the fact that the porch has a mesh portion to drain off any standing water. I may put a small tarp over the screen room if it rains. But you really don\'t need it if you don\'t want to do that. All in all, I am very pleased with this tent with the exception of those couple of things I mentioned in the porch portion. And even then, I wouldn\'t return the tent because of them. I\'m pleased with it.', ""We've used this tent for a few camping trips in the last 2 years. This last one we had to put it up in the rain. Fortunately the inside of the tent was dry. We had to wipe up some water with a paper towel for water that got through the top while we were figuring out the rain fly but no other water got in. We were impressed that it was as dry as it was inside and had a fun night hanging out inside the tent. The third night on this trip it rained most the night but again, the inside stayed dry. The porch will be soaked and muddy if it rains and you're in and out but when it's not raining, it's good for storing your shoes and chairs etc. It's not hard to put up although the rainfly can be challenging when it's pouring down rain! The directions for the tent are sewn right inside the tent bag so once we reviewed that, we were able to get the rainfly on correctly. Two of sleep in it and have plenty of room for board games and all of our gear. Could sleep 4 ppl pretty comfortably but anymore than that would be pushing it. We're very happy with this tent."", 'This is the largest tent I have owned. I\'ve only used backpacking tents so this is like a house to me. I\'ve always wanted a tent that had a ""porch"" before you went inside to collect the bugs and this one does the trick. The bug net from the porch goes all the way up to the top of the main tent dome. It is where all the bugs conglomerate and is easy to clear out with a shop vac but who\'s got power when they\'re camping so gotta look into a way to clear that out. The porch is half covered by the rainfly and you will get rain inside. I have a solution for that with a backpacking tarp but keep that in mind if you store your gear on the porch. There is a space on the floor between the porch and the main tent that I guess the newer models like mine have netting sewn in. This stops water from getting to the main part of the tent and then also keeps bugs out. The door is a half door so one person or one set of gear at a time. Lots of room for my extra large cot. I\'m 5\' 8"" and my head touches the peak of the ceiling. Just two gear pockets on adjacent corners and then one mesh gear hammock for the ceiling also a tie ring for lantern. The rainfly ties down really good and is just a little pain to do by oneself but is doable. Really good airflow. The floor seems basic but I always put a heavy tarp down beforehand. The stakes are basic I will probably get better twisted ones. For the price, size, ease to set up solo, weather capabilities, and the durability or Coleman I give this tent five stars. This is after two weeks testing in my backyard with high winds and intermittent rain.', ""This is an awesome tent for our small family.\n\nSIZE: It says this is a six person tent and I am sure you could fit six people in it but you would be packed like sardines. This is true for EVERY tent. Anyone who has owned a tent knows that you take the manufacturer count and divide that by 2. It fits 3 people comfortably with some room for anything you want stored inside the tent. The porch is a nice plus. This is a great place to store shoes and coolers. Also a great place to sit but we haven't used it for that purpose yet.\n\nSET UP: This was extremely easy to set up with 2 people. We haven't used the rainfly yet but this took about 10 minutes for a first time setup. I imagine it would take less time in the future now that we know how to do it.\n\nQUALITY: I love all the windows. We camped in the fall (southern fall) and there was plenty of air flowing through the tent keeping us cool. It hasn't rained yet but I don't think there would be any issues with rain based upon how it is designed.\n\nSUMMARY: Overall great tent for a small family or couple. This was the first time I had a tent with a porch. I have always wanted one and I don't think I can ever go back unless I am backcountry camping. This really helps prevent dirt from getting tracked into the tent and it is a great way to keep bugs out of your tent. Great value for the price. I will give an update if we ever camp in the rain.""]","[['The text is too big to be classified'], [['POSITIVE', 0.998501181602478]], [['NEGATIVE', 0.9788559079170227]], [['POSITIVE', 0.9826943278312683]], ['The text is too big to be classified'], [['NEGATIVE', 0.9003254771232605]], [['NEGATIVE', 0.9895985126495361]], [['POSITIVE', 0.6494749188423157]], [['NEGATIVE', 0.9050331115722656]], [['POSITIVE', 0.997989296913147]]]"

Beware that the abundance of mesh makes this tent a poor choice for cold weather camping, and the heavy weight (30+lbs) is not ideal if you plan on hiking to your camping spot.\n\nTent Dimensions\n- The bedroom is 9ft long x 10ft wide\n- The screen room is 4ft long x 10ft wide\n- The vestibule extends out an additional 3ft\n- The tent stands at 6ft 4in high at the tallest point\n- Without the rainfly (and therefore without the vestibule), the total dimensions are 13ft long x 10ft wide\n- With the rainfly (including the vestibule), the total dimensions are 16ft long x 10ft wide\n\nPros\n- Phenomenal ventilation, even with the rainfly on\n- Extremely spacious interior: can (barely) fit 2 queen-sized air mattresses side-by-side\n- Huge, beautiful windows\n- The screen room is amazing! Great place to setup some chairs for bug-free lounging. The screen room also helps keep mud out of the bedroom\n- Multiple storage pouches\n- Relatively easy to setup (appx 15 minutes with 2 people)\n- Has port for extension cord. The port has a zipper to keep out bugs\n- Can stand up inside the tent (6ft 4in tall in center)\n- Vestibule area in the front of the tent is convenient for stowing gear out of the rain\n- Floor vent helps with air ventilation when the windows must be zipped up during rain\n\nCons\n- Very heavy (30+ lbs)\n- No good place to hang a tent light (the ceiling is entirely mesh)\n- Storage pouches are high on the walls, which means you must stand up to access the contents\n- The screen room DOES protect against rain but DOES NOT protect against flooding ground water. The screen room only has tub floors on 3 sides... the front is mesh only. So flooding water could pour in from the front. However, part of the floor in the screen room is mesh, which helps to drain the water. Please note that this issue would only arise in a flood, not a simple rainfall\n- Screen room doesn\'t completely zip up, there is a small gap between the zippers which lets bugs inside\n- Coleman could\'ve picked better colors. This thing looks like it\'s from the 90s\n- The rainfly only has partial coverage, which isn\'t ideal for camping in heavy rainfall. The windows must be zipped up when it\'s raining, which will contribute to heat buildup inside\n- Lots of mesh = great ventilation for warm nights... but contributes to poor insulation for cold weather camping. This tent is built for 2 seasons (late spring, summer, early fall)\n- Expensive\n- Stakes aren\'t heavy duty. May need to replace after several uses', ""I don't even know where to start with this sweet tent. First of all, I am writing this review because I was SUPER annoyed that NOBODY could give the inside dimensions of the 4 person, not including the porch. It looks like it is 7' x 8' by my measurement. from the end of the porch to the back of the tent is 7' with the width being 8'. This made it even MORE perfect as we have more room on the sides.\n\nNow, I wasn't 100% sure what to expect. This adorable little Hobbit Hole has a screened tent and one of the few where it is entirely enclosed. We have a very curious little Australian Shepherd that loves to get up close and personal with critters and often refuses to come into the tent. She just wants to sleep outside. Note that she is EXTRA fuzzy and sheds all year long and is always warm. Add to her conundrum of loving camping but being miserable that we had to jam her dog bed between the air mattress and the tent edge, she would be restless and end up kicking us out of bed. This little screen porch allows us to keep her fully enclosed while allowing her to stay cool and have her all-night-critter-stake-out.\n\nSo you're thinking, whatever... you live in Arizona... How does this badboy hold up in the rain? Well, last night, an insane monsoon rolled in. We are talking high winds, crazy rain and hail, lightnings and rivers of water running under the tent. I had already emptied a can of Kiwi water repellant (the heavy duty camp one) on the rain fly and the seams so water was beading off of it. I was able to observe where water was hitting hardest during the gales. No leaks. We stayed in the tent for the worst of the wind so it wouldn't blow away, expecting the tie downs to pop out and the fly to at least do just that. Flyyyyy. Nope. After 45 minutes, boyfriend, Fuzzy Aussie and I headed up to the house and hoped for the best. It did rain throughout the night on and off. This morning, it was bone dry. I let it dry and then unzipped all the windows and sprayed another can of kiwi water proofing directly into the outside facing windows (and not through the screen) since that is where the fly doesn't really cover. We didn't have issues at all. It dries fast and odorless and it is just worth it to invest in a couple of cans of this magical spray and go to town. Massive difference.\n\n5 stars all the way. I gave a 4 for durability because despite putting a tarp underneath it, the mesh bottom for drainage has a tiny hole from a rock (which I will sew together) and one of the inside door tie-backs came off the first time I tried to snap it on. Looks like it wasn't sewn together properly. I'll sew that on and good to go. But holey schnikeys, this tent is super sweet. We upgraded the tent pegs because no offense Coleman but those janky wire looking pegs haven't impressed anyone since the 60s. Just no.\n\nOur setup:\n\n- Coleman 4 person cabin style tent with screened porch\n- Eurmax heavy duty tent stakes (worth the investment)\n- Kiwi Camp Dry Heavy Duty Water Repellant\n- REDCAMP Large waterproof 4 in 1 Camping Tarp (we like a tarp under the tent)\n\nLike a bloody CHARM! I couldn't get the Fuzzy Australia Shepherd OUT of the tent for a change. And the little porch is even MORE amazing than I expected."", 'Took this tent camping 2 weeks ago, it did rain but we had zero water intrusion. This is an excellent, roomy design, and I love being able to stand up in it. It lacks a center roof hanger for gear/light but it does have ample pockets in the rear corners. I will be installing some wire string LED\'s to provide light this weekend at a Scout camping trip. It\'s gonna be a wet one, will update this review if I have any issues. One last note - this tent is THE BEST TENT I\'ve ever used with regard to ventilation. I had this tent set up in my back yard for a Scout meeting, and everyone noted how it felt cooler in the tent than it did outside. My wife and I were very comfortable camping in 80 degree weather.\n**update - I\'ve now been using this tent for 2 years with frequent camping trips with the Scouts. I\'ve installed LED string lights which was a great upgrade. This tent is definitely on the large side, so there have been times where finding a good place to put it has been a challenge, but the benefits outweigh this potential downfall. The way this tent is designed, there is always ample air flow at all times, as it seems to capture the wind from any angle and passes it through the tent. It\'s great for me and one other person with all of our gear, and still having PLENTY of room to move about and stand upright. I do recommend waxing the zippers regularly. The screened ""porch"" makes it very easy to keep the dirty boots out of the main area.', 'We haven\'t slept in it yet, but I set it up for the first time, by myself, in about 20 minutes. The screened area is generous and totally big enough for a couple full size chairs plus a cooler, etc., and the ""windows"" are awesome because you can see the outside even with the rainfly on and should allow for good airflow. My only complaint is that there isn\'t really a good place to hang a lantern or tent light in the interior, but I can live with that.\n\nThe four person tent will feel like a mansion when I\'m camping alone, and looks like it\'ll fit our two full size twin blowup mattresses when the hubs comes along. Granted it\'ll be a little tight, but it\'ll be super comfy. If we use our camp mattresses there\'ll be plenty of room for all our stuff.\n\nA totally rad ""glamping"" tent, especially when combined with our Coleman canopy.\n\nUpdated - we\'ve camped with this tent several times now. It\'s easy to set up and put away, our twin aero beds fit with space in between or on the sides for clothes, a stool, whatnot. I\'ll put a tarp over the top in cooler weather as it does not retain heat in any way (but it also cools off quick in warm weather once the sun goes down), but other than that, it\'s working out pretty great for us! I\'d say it was a great buy overall.', 'Bought this tent for vehicle camping and needed something to easily fit two cots or one queen size inflatable mattress. This is plenty big enough plus someone could sleep in the front screen room. Ventilation is good. I recommend setting up with the longer side of the tent in alignment with the wind direction to increase cross flow front to back if the rain fly is on. Probably not relevant if you forego the rain fly. Setup time: about 20 minutes for the first try. Tear down time: 15 minutes. Easily fits back into its case once you fold the tent up in accordance to the instructions and roll it up around the tent pole bag. I set it up by myself, but as with most tents, a second set of hands would really speed up the process. As for a good representation of the floor space, I setup two cots, with plenty of room between them. Luggage on the floor. Cooler in the corner. Two chairs in the screen room with a small table. Finally, all the other BS you bring camping strung around. I\'m 5\'10"" and had plenty of room to stand up in the tent. As for durability, its like any other medium weight tent. Take care of it and you will get many trips out of it. However, don\'t expect to set it up in your backyard all summer for you kids to play in it. Likely a full summer in the sun and rain would wear it out fast. Think more along the lines of 5-6 weekend trips per year for 10+ years.', ""This is a great tent! The tent goes up in 10-15 minutes after the initial setup. The rain fly takes about the same time. We got the 6 person and with two cots it is the perfect size. Can stand up fully and move around. The airflow is marvelous with all the windows and netting. Absolutely love the screened porch! Put our chairs there and read / watched the fire when it got too buggy outside. Withstood heavy thunder storm and remained bone dry. It's like having a cabin."", ""We got the 6 person for the two of us.\n\nPROS:\n- comfy for 6ft tall person\n- big enough for queen mattress with room to spare (pushed to back and 2-2.5 ft all around)\n- porch is fine for two people to sit in camp chairs and not feel like the porch screen is coming in on you\n- decently easy set-up compared to other large tents with lots of poles, the third set-up I was able to do by myself. Stake the tent down first in all four corners. It took 10-15 min.\n- the packing bag expands and the everything fits back in pretty easily.\n- the front sides of the rainfly that extent off the porch are pretty long and would give privacy\n- kept rain out for two days and we didn’t do any extra sealing\n\nCONS:\n- not really anywhere to attach something from the ceiling or the corners.\n- large, which is comfortable, but also means it is a bit colder\n- the side windows don't get an overhang from the rainfly, so rain can get in if not closed most of the way\n- the 'porch' has a fairly good overhang and probably wouldn't get wet from fairly straight down rain, but unsure about side rain"", 'We have had this tent for a year now. Three different trips, and we are pleased with our purchase. I had a budget, my husband is 6’4”, and we wanted something he could stand up in. Naturally, that limited our choices. I hesitated buying a Coleman tent because my past perceptions have been that they are kind of cheap feeling and wouldn’t hold up. So far so good! And very nice tent for the price of a night in a hotel room.\nThings we love:\n1. it’s a good warm weather tent with lots of bug proof, mesh.\n2. Love, love the covered screen porch. It makes a nice landing spot for shoes and it’s big enough for a couple of camp chairs if it’s buggy, or even to sit in while you put on your shoes.\n3. We are getting older and after knee surgery, my knees are tired of crawling in and out of a tent. The tent is tall, but so is the door.\n4. It’s big enough for a full sized queen mattress, all our junk at our fingertips, a chair inside, and a big bed for the Great Dane who camps with us without feeling crowded.\n5. Once you get the hang of it, it goes up pretty quickly. And once staked out it doesn’t feel like it’s going anywhere in windy weather.\n6. The windows zip and unzip on the inside, which seems like a no-brainer, but apparently isn’t.\nQuirky things, not necessarily cons, but to be aware.\n1. I wish the rain fly had more coverage, it hasn’t leaked yet, but we haven’t had a really heavy storm in it yet, so who knows\n2. It goes together counterintuitively to any tent rain fly I’ve ever put up, so a bit confusing at first. We keep thinking the Coleman label should be in the front, but it’s not.\n3. I wish it had a central light hook, but the pockets work ok for that. And with the barrel design it wouldn’t work, anyway.\n4. The floor seems a bit thin, so I feel like a heavy duty tarp is essential if it’s rocky or you are in the mountains.\n5. This is definitely not a cold weather tent. All that mesh and the tall ceiling will not keep you warm.', ""Was able to put it up an take it down by myself (and I've had a stroke), and with two of us, it was a breeze. Last trip was on and off moderate rain in 40F degrees , and I was warm and high and dry with absolutely no water inside. The ventilation was more than adequate to keep condensation non-existent, but was still warm. The vestibule is great for keeping out the rain, and for setting two in lawn chairs under cover while the squall passes. Also, with the vestibule and a rug outside and in the vestibule, the mud and dirt was kept comfortably outside. The tent held up perfectly in a moderate wind. The floor was sturdy in the face of the many acorns that could not be swept up. I am more than pleased with this tent."", 'I bought this as an upgrade from my boyfriend and I’s previous 4 person dome tent which we hated having to crawl into on our knees. I love being able to walk right in; the sleeping area is perfect for 2 people plus gear (as all “4 person” tents are) and the enclosed “porch” is awesome for leaving shoes out and away from the stuff you want to keep clean. Assembly was easy enough to figure out but would be hard to do solo, in my opinion.

It rained a lot camping in Florida in July, and we had no problems with water. I like the placement of the storage compartments, the ventilation, the power cord opening, the colors, the open screen ceiling, the zippers, the doors, the fast easy-to-lengthen supports really set it apart from other tents. That's what makes it go up so fast. It's not tedious in any way.

With this product We decided to do a review months after we used it. We went on a 10 day camping trip through northern Michigan with our 2 and 4 year olds. This was our first trip for the kids and the wife. I actually teach outdoor education, survival skills, team building, and everything that comes with it for over 15 years and countless experience prior. All I need in the woods is about 5 items and I would do just fine for quite some time. My wife and kids on the other hand need much, much, much more. So we planned this trip pretty hard core and invested in a ton of things that most would not -the main thing was a portable potty and a tent for that- and of course a tent. We picked this tent after searching and searching for what would work best for our family.\n\nWe traveled from spot to spot only spending a few days at a time in locations and covered some miles. This tent saw the dunes, rugged campsites, perfect campsite, grass, sand, dirt, mud, rain, thunderstorms, flooding, you name it. It held strong. The kids were happy and most important the wife was happy. This was her very first camping trip and she loved it. This is something i was worried about and i went to great lengths to make this a perfect trip so we can do this over and over again. Camping is a dying art and i grew up camping and in my mind mastered it. So it was a win for our family and me.\n\nWe waterproofed this tent with a spray. We made sure the fly was perfect and this thing was staked down properly each time. This is very very important. It takes time to get that right with a new tent but history has taught me a ton. I have read reviews and most of the bad ones i can tell you right now are people that had no clue what they were doing and did not put in the time to master the most important tool of a camping trip. The tent. We spent hours mastering this tent before we even hit the road. HOURS. When you pull up to set up you best have a plan and know your tent. If you dont then im sure you will take it out by writing a bad review and making guys like me laugh. Thanks for that. Put in the time.\n\nI am attaching a video of our biggest challenge on our massive adventure. We were in the middle of nowhere on our 6th day when the mother of all thunderstorms and flood maker arrived at our campsite. It kinda takes a lot for me to worry in any situation. I worried for about 2 min and knew we were good. Being confident in your tent when you are hours from a hotel is a great feeling. I can say this about this tent. My wife and kids hearts were pounding and they were straight up scared while I was loving the thrill. Once everyone knew we were not going to float away and our tent was water tight it turned out to be pretty fun and a heart pounding memory we all will keep forever. Put in the time, dont let camping become a dying art, and oh ya....PUT IN THE TIME. Your wife will thank you later....', 'We are occasional (1-2x per year) car-campers with a decades-long history of doing this. As such, we\'ve gone through a number of tents.\n\nWhat we are looking for in a tent is pretty specific.\n- It needs to fit at least 4 people (2 adults, 2 kids in the range of 8-13 years) comfortably. In reality, this means that a tent needs to be rated for 6 adults\n- Ideally. the tent can be set up and broken down by 1 adult or 1 adult + 1 child in no more than 15-20 minutes\n- The tent (including frame) must be sturdy and not deteriorate when in storage\n\nSo after pitching it in my backyard, leaving it overnight, and breaking it up again, here\'s my assessment.\n\nPOSITIVES:\n- After the first struggles of ""which pole goes where"", setting it up was easy and could be done by 1 adult if needed. Total first-time setup time was about 25 minutes. This means that next time, I can probably do it in about 15-20 minutes.\n- The design is good. It provides a separation of a ""living""/""storage"" space from the ""sleeping"" space. This is important if you want to keep your sleeping space relatively clean / dirt free.\n- The quality and assembly appeared to be good as well. The seams were waterproofed and the sown-in tarp goes up a few inches onto the wall, which will prevent rainwater entering the tent\n- Plenty of instructions. Sawn-in instructions in the storage bag on how to pitch the tent. Paper inserts on how to fold it. How to avoid moisture. Et cetera.\n- The window covered were well designed and can be stored in a pocket at the bottom of the window\n- It was easy to get the tent with all accessories back into the storage bag afterwards. No problems at all.\n- The rear (sleeping) space was large enough to fit 2 queen air mattresses.\n\nNEUTRAL:\n- It was hard to get the walls of the tent to be wrinkle-free. This is a cosmetic issue more than anything else.\n- It\'s definely a ""car camping"" tent. It\'s too heavy for backpacking.\n\nNEGATIVES:\n- The thick, yellow plastic tent pins came loose overnight. There was some wind (variable, less than 15 mph) overnight but nothing that would merit special caution.\n- The dark colored rain fly made it extremely hot in the tent during the day, in the sun, even with all windows opened.\n- Minor item - it lacks a hole to pull an electric cable through. Less important with the abundance of cheap portable chargers for our electronics, but still something we have used once in a while.\n\n(Note - No special consideration was received for writing this unsolicited review.

It\'s dumb. And it opens the wrong way.\nWhat I did is installed another zipper and turned into a ""D"" opening.\nNow it isn\'t bad.\nOther than that, this tent is perfect.

I'm still looking for something a bit smaller for backpacking so please feel free to leave me your opinions on some cost effective options. I purchased this one for my family to use, that would be me and my husband (30 something adults) and two teenagers.\n\nI LOVE this tent! having a screened in porch with an attached floor is amazing!!!!!!!! No bugs or frogs in our food! I love the space. This tent is great for summer time due to all the ventilation and mesh and thin walls. I would imagine due to it's size and thin fabric it wouldn't be a good choice for winder time or colder areas.\n\nFor setup, I know several said that it was hard to setup but my husband and I did it our first time in 15 minutes and it was relatively easy to do. I can see how it would be difficult with one person because you have to lift the dome part of the bigger/back room up into the air so if you are going to be alone it could be challenge.\n\nAnother concern for this tent was that the porch is a good 6 to 8 inches shorter in height than the bedroom. You can fully stand up in the bedroom and move around but I had to bend my head in porch and I'm only 5'4. :-) But the porch is mostly to be used as a storage area and sitting room anyway.\n\nI caught this tent on sale for $120 and it was worth every penny! Even full price at $160 I think it would be worth it."", ""Great, spacious. easy to assemble. I'm 6'1 and could stand comfortably in the main bedroom. We had tworking full Coleman cots with side tables on them and still a wide space on either side. The front room was lower, but a great feature for storing all our stuff/mud room etc. We loved all the open window options and the roof for star gazing etc. Well made tent. We used it for the first time camping at Red Top Mountain state park in GA. Second night, had a very heavy thunderstorm with excessive rain. Tent stayed dry! (The roof cover worked very well) It was a good test. We really loved this tent. Not necessarily an 8 person size....you'd have to get really creative. Lol"", ""I just recently purchased this tent and took it out over night to get a feel for it. First things first...this tent is so simple to put together. I was afraid it would take a while. The hardest part was staking it in and even that was simple. The instructions are clear and are sewn into the bag so you wont worry about them being lost. This tent is so roomy. We had a queen sized air mattress and a twin with room to spare. We could have fit another twin if we needed too. I am really pleased with this tent. I was unsure because the price was a lot lower then some other 8-person tents but I would buy this again without thinking twice. We camped out on the beach and there was a good breeze throughout the night and the tent didn't budge at all."", ""This tent is amazing!!!! I read the reviews before purchasing, so I was aware that there may be a structural issue with a sag on one side. I did not experience that. The structure was perfect. We camped for 7 days in Vermont, on a somewhat rainy week. I sprayed the fly and exposed seams with waterproofing spray after I set it up and stayed completely dry all week. 4 of us set up the tent in about 10 minutes. My sister, a friend and I took it down, and got it back in the bag in about 15 minutes (minus the time it took to take off the fly and hang it to dry). The tent was so roomy and wonderful. We've all camped there for about 27 years, and the tent got rave reviews from all 15 campers. I definitely recommend this!!!"", 'We camp often in the Midwest with older kids who have their own tent. I needed something that accommodated our double cot, and provided a covered kitchen storage area that the teens could access without entering our sleeping area. We\'ve just returned from our 6 day trip, so it\'s time to review.\n\nSet-up was a breeze. We did a practice run at home before setting out, thinking we knew what we were doing. The durn thing wouldn\'t stand up! At the camping site we actually read the directions on the bag, staking it down first, and it was up in less than 10 minutes. I have since put it up by myself. I have mobility issues and it took me 15 minutes to set it up.\n\nThe land we were camping on is not level, and we made sure to point the entrance downhill. It rained heavily during our excursion, and we noticed that the flooring of the screened portion doesn\'t come up much when it\'s all zipped up. Three zippers meet in the bottom middle. We didn\'t have a problem because of the grade we were on.\n\nThe door for the sleeping section is all-or-nothing. It is in a circle and unzips clockwise from 9 o\'clock when going in to the sleeping section. We found this mildly irritating. At the same time, the threshold is high enough to discourage critters. Our sleeping area remained bug-free, despite the screen section being open most of the time. I love how the screened section acts as a covered porch for entry into the sleeping section.\n\nWe experienced a thunderstorm during our trip. Everything stayed dry. I like how the screen section can be closed up. We also strategically zipped up the screen sections to keep our food storage and coolers in shade.\n\nThe cross-breeze from the windows in the sleeping section was marvelous. We are not tall people (Hubby is gallant at 5\'7"" and I\'m a whopping 5\'1"") and we have our double cot in the middle. There was enough head clearance for us on the sides. I think it would be fine for taller people if their bedding is on the periphery.\n\nI\'m very pleased. This saved us the packing space and hassle of taking a mesh tent or canopy for our kitchen and general storage.', ""I bought this tent two years ago and this has bed my home away from home while camping. It is so spacious! I go camping about 5 or 6 times a year and this tent has been so sturdy! No rips or zipper breaks yet. It has been through rain, snow, wind and heat! Easy to set up as lo g as you're not alone! With two people its 10 minutes tops once you get the hang of it! So easy. Folds up nicely into the bag also!\n\nRain: I weather proof my tents! I'd recommend a seam seal on it! I use the front room as a storage for my bin and toilet (if there's no toilet in the campground) and the other room fits the queen mattress for my girlfriend and me, with plenty of space for backpacks\n\nRain: the first time I used this tent there was an unexpected shower and I hadn't sealed the seams... resulted in some very very small leaks. All tents should be weather sealed no matter what though.\n\nSnow: one side did collapse but that's because it snowed a lot over night! I'm surprised the whole thing didn't just fall down with the layer of snow onto of it. This tent is tough!\n\nWind: stood its ground! I bought a few extra heavy duty stakes and made sure to tie the rain cover down really well. It stayed through the craziest wind storm uve ever experienced camping!\n\nHeat: it gets pretty warm inside but with pretty much all of it being a window if zipped down it gets great airflow!\n\nThe best tent I've owned! So many fun times everyone running into our cabin tent when it rains because it's so homey and big. Playing games till the shower passes."", 'I have been camping all of my life. Hundreds of camping trips, dozens of tents. We needed a ig tent for our little family because we have small children and they require a lot of stuff. We have had this tent for three seasons. It has camped in AZ, WA, AK, MI, and IN. We spray it with waterproofing spray twice per season to keep it primed.\nPros:\nit\'s huge. We can easily fit 3 queen air mattresses in it and still have room for bags and junk.\nDivided rooms means naptime and morning time are a little easier.\nGood ventilation, lots of windows!\nGood quality. Zippers and seams have held up to child shenanigans, weather, and general wear and tear.\nYou can stand up in it.\nTwo adults can set it up in about 15 minutes.\n\nCons:\nNot wind friendly because it is so tall. It\'s fine for a good breeze, but a strong wind almost makes it go sideways.\nNot a fan of the ""lip"" at the doors. Makes sweeping harder.\nRequires two people to set up.\nReally heavy!

I’m not much on tent camping, but I decided on this one and was on the fence when I first assembled it in the yard. I took it out on its first use camping in the mountains. Wow, I was pleasantly happy. No rain, so that will be an update later perhaps. Went together easily and quickly, even in the dark with a small headlamp and only second time assembling. Tent lost a star for the pockets that are inside are at my head and face. And I do wish the screened in area was taller. I have a small camp chair so that worked for me and it made it much easier to put on my boots while sitting. Others may not be so comfortable sitting in the small screened in area. I liked it!!! Overall, I’m happy on my purchase, and would buy again.', 'Enjoyed the tent and ease of installation. It did not rain so can’t speak to that, but it has a lot of space and most of the materials are high quality. I just wish they would have charged me a little more and used high quality netting. Multiple holes found upon unboxing.\n\nOur family camps often and so we have multiple tents including a roof top. I’ve never seen thinner net material.\n\nOtherwise we like the tent so far. Will update again after multiple uses.', 'Family camping 🏕', ""For a family of 5 this tent is a great size, the secondary room in the front is sweet for storing water packs shoes and other items you don't want covered in wet due in the morning. It is also a great changing area with all the windows zipped up you get great privacy and room the change while standing up. I love the storage pockets with the dividers in it, holds phones, power packs, eye glasses, keys, wallets very nicely. There is a little ring at the top center to hang a light as well, but I did have one issue with the storage pouches. We had it setup with two queen size blow up mattresses in it.\n\nSome things I did not like was how the rain fly uses these awkward velcro loops that are hard to attach and keep attached. Mine was missing one of the para cord lines only had 5 instead of the six it should have for securing to the ground.\n\nWe had ours tied down the best we could with a missing line with a total of 9 anker points it handled high winds just fine, others smaller 3 man tents loaded with gear blew 50 to 100 feet away. The wind gust were strong standing with your feet together it would knock you over.\n\nWhile I like the net storage pouches with a 4 inch blowup mattress on the floor and a pillow the folks on the side had there faces hitting the net pouches. I really wish they installed the net pouches on the sides of the tent.\n\nWith one person putting up the tent with the rain fly and securing all the ankers to the ground will take about 15 to 20 minutes. No way this can be done in 5 minutes. Taking down the tent and wrapping up all the cords, folding and packing into the provided carry back takes about 10 to 15 minutes."", ""I'm currently reviewing this for setup, features, and construction, since it's not really camping season for us (I'll update after we've used it outside our back yard, but Coleman is a reliable enough brand that I don't feel too worried about it for general camping).\n\nImportantly, this tent is relatively heavy and it must be staked to set/stay up properly. If you do a lot of hike-in backcountry camping, or on rocky terrain, this won't be a good fit. If you mostly set up your tent in drive up spots at the state or national parks, this will be perfect, extra roomy but with a setup as fast as an itty bitty tent.\n\nFirst off, it is huge! But it is quite easy to set up, even with one smallish woman, as long as you stretch it out and stake it first. If it's not staked, it will be exceedingly difficult to set up solo and it will be very unstable--and unless you're very tall, you won't be able to get the rainfly on. I learned this because I first tried to set it up indoors (my usual routine with a new tent), but without the stability of staking, it sort of schooches together and up, giving it a smaller footprint and greater height--much too great for me to reach over. (The model we have, the 8 person tent, is much larger than the one currently shown in the video.) Without staking, the poles felt awkward, and the cords felt too stretchy and loosey-goosey, but the feel was completely different and correct with the corners secured, giving you something to flex it against.\nAs long as it's staked, it goes up easily and quickly. The attached poles mean no guessing, which is especially great if it's dark or you're in a hurry. Using the wrong poles is impossible. It's a very simple design, so as long as it's staked, setup is a breeze. You simply unfold one pole, stick the end of it into the pocket on the diagonal corner, repeat on the other side, then clip on the hooks, starting at the top center. From there, just unfold the remaining pole and stick an end in each front corner, then hook on the screen room hooks. Then attach the rainfly. The rainfly and tent even have a color-coded corner as the starting point, so as long as it's rightside-up (obvious because of the taped seams on the interior), there's no question which way the rainfly goes on, either.\n\nThe main room is easily the size of a big pop-up canopy, and the headroom is outstanding. We're short people, so this tent was incredibly room for us, but I think it would be comfy even for a tall person. And the shape is boxy, not round, so that you can move around in the tent without hunching over, not just stand up in the very middle.\n\nThe screen room is the full width and a bit less than half the depth of the main room, so plenty of room to set up a few chairs and chill out away from mosquitos, and play cards.\n\nThe zippers are great, very sturdy, heavy duty zippers, more like a heavy coat than your average tent, and the fabric doesn't constantly get caught in it like most of my previous tents.\n\nIt has the usual little gear holder for the ceiling, and the phone pockets that are now pretty standard in tents, but always handy, plus the welcome mat, a little mini tarp for the entrance so you can leave your shoes.\n\nThe bag is about the size of a large gym bag, and I was about to complain about how hard it was to pack back up (though I did it successfully with some effort), until I noticed that you can pull out a strip at the bottom and expand the size of the bag. If you prefer the tradeoff of a smaller bag for the extra effort, you can also leave it as it comes.\n\nAll in all, I'm really excited to use this tent! While it's an obvious choice for longer trips, it goes up so easy (without the poles to puzzle over and catch in channels), it may well become our go-to tent even for short weekend trips."", ""This is a superb tent for non-backwoods family camping. It's winter, so we haven't taken it camping yet, but it will be perfect for our family trips to the Hiawatha National Forest in Michigan's Upper Peninsula where we camp in a primitive campground on the shore of Lake Michigan for a week at a time. This is a big, heavy, roomy tent. It will hold up to rain and wind--and when it's raining out, the tent has room for a family to sit out the rainstorm playing games inside.\n\nThe screen room is a nice sort of adjunct/vestibule to the tent which can be made weather tight. It is separated from the main body of the tent by a panel with a door in it, and the roof and sides of this portion of the tent are screen. However, with the fly placed over the tent, the screen room is covered and there are closable covers for all the side panels, rendering the screen room weathertight when closed.\n\nNice tub floor. Easy to set up. Fairly vertical walls give greater headroom. This is just a fine put-it-up-and-live-in-it-for-a-week tent. Packs up nicely into its carrying case. A fine tent for general camping. Easily fits a family of eight that isn't afraid of close quarters."", 'Time to put up:\n\nIt\'s possible to have this tent ""mostly"" up in 5 minutes, but having it staked and fully ready to go takes closer to 12-14 minutes. To me, that\'s still plenty quick, but I thought it would be helpful to make clear this is not a 5 minute tent.\n\nTime to take down:\n\nJust like any other tent, this one takes about twice the amount of time to take down and pack up as it does to put up.\n\nWeight:\n\nMake no mistake, this is a fairly large tent, and as such, it\'s not particularly light. However, it does pack down to a relatively compact size. This is more of a ""travel to your destination"" tent, as opposed to one that\'s good for taking along on a weekend backpacking trip. At the same time, I have managed to backpack with this tent more than once, I just had to get a little creative with it.\n\nDurability:\n\nIf this tent is staked properly, it\'s going to be just fine in any basic weather situation. With that said, this is not the tent you want to be sleeping in a windstorm, very heavy rain, or snow.\n\nRoominess:\n\nCould this tent sleep 8? Yes. However, I feel it\'s substantially more well suited to 6 adults.\n\nBottom line:\n\nThis is a very good large tent. It\'s easy to put up, and break down. It\'s stable, and fairly roomy. It\'s built to last for at least several seasons of use. Overall, I feel it\'s a strong value.\n\n4 stars', 'this tent is awesome. it has a large interior and an enclosed screen room as well. i really like the way the tent has easy to setup poles already attached, it really saves time so everyone can get busy enjoying the outdoors.\n\nour old tent was a decade old if not older and had been through several trips with rambunctious boys. needless to say it was ready to retire after the last trip. this tent is so much easier to setup and is overall much larger inside. it has a large screen area that we can store all our gear in rather than in the sleeping area like the old one. this one is also much easier to pack up and store in the included carry bag.\n\nif you need a new tent i would highly recommend this one as its a Coleman which means its made to last. plus the ease of getting it up and ready to use cant be beat, especially if you\'re kids are there impatiently waiting to ""do something fun"".', ""We're considering this tent & I created a couple of diagrams to help analyze & decide... I thought others might find these helpful. We're comparing this to the Skylodge 12p, our current Marmot Limestone 6p & other family tents we've owned.

Opened the tent up though just to see how it was for the review. Pretty easy to set up (although I do have experience in setting up tents) and very spacious inside... all my years as a scout I wish I had a tent like this one. The ""screen room"" concept is interesting but a little over-stated I think but not enough to knock a star off.\nOverall I am happy with the tent from my minor opening perspective, will update the review when I go to use it if my experience turns out to be different.']","[[['POSITIVE', 0.9961672425270081]], [['POSITIVE', 0.9971215128898621]], [['POSITIVE', 0.9943714737892151]], [['NEGATIVE', 0.9824535846710205]], ['The text is too big to be classified'], [['POSITIVE', 0.9971447587013245]], [['POSITIVE', 0.9875078797340393]], [['POSITIVE', 0.9974364638328552]], [['POSITIVE', 0.9884704351425171]], [['POSITIVE', 0.9963285326957703]]]"

I just wanted to update, since we have used the Browning Big Horn Family Tent for three camping seasons (2014, 2015 & 2016) so far. This tent has been amazing! We have camped in conditions with cold/hot temperatures, high winds, severe rain and hail. Yes, HAIL. The tent has held up beautifully, through all of our camping adventures, and I would still highly recommend this tent. In regards to the flooring, it did leak a little during our trip to Steamboat Springs. Considering it rained every single morning and afternoon/evening, it didn\'t actually leak until the day it hailed for 40 minutes straight. It wasn\'t light hail, it was torrential. I noticed it was coming through one of the doors, that was facing the direction of the hail. Not a problem though, the rest of tent did great. I called ALPS/Browning when we got back and the customer service was amazing, they said it shouldn\'t have leaked, and sent a replacement tent body the next day!! This was the second time, I had to call about a replacement part, the first was about a tension rod that had broken and they sent a replacement for that next day as well. Besides the tent, the customer service and warranty service agents are fantastic! An excellent tent, backed by a great company. Me and my family love this tent! We are so excited to start the 2017 camping season with the Big Horn Tent.\n\n(ORIGINAL REVIEW - MAY 2014)\nThis past weekend, we were finally able to put the tent up for the first time, before going on a community campout this weekend in our HOA\'s backcountry. First, we put down our footprint (heavy duty reversible tarp from Costco) and then pulled out the tent, poles, stakes and rainfly. The instructions were very clear and concise, and are sewn directly into the storage bag so you don’t need to worry about it getting lost. Once we had the tent folded out completely, and all of the poles extended it took my husband and I, about 15 minutes to complete the setup (and we’re novices). The tent when it is complete is 10 x 15 feet, and a center height of 7’ 3’’. My husband is 6’1’’ had PLENTY of headroom all around the tent and not just standing in the middle. He does have to bend down slightly when entering the tent, but he didn’t find that to be an issue. The tent and floor material seem to be high quality and very durable for a $300 tent. It will have to withstand me, my husband, our 5 year-old daughter and 2 Samoyeds ( 45 lbs. and 85 lbs.).\n\nThe tent can be divided into two rooms, each room on one side of the zippered divider panel has 3 pockets for storage. Each room has its own separate entrance, which we absolutely love! There is one hook in the middle, that can be used for handing a lantern. There are 6 windows (4 on the walls and 1 on each door). One thing I would like to mention, is that there are no tie backs for the windows on the walls or the door. Not an issue for us, but something to note when purchasing. In one room, we set up 3 sleeping cots which are each 75""L x 25""W x 16""H, and they fit perfectly, taking into account about 5 inches of space in between the cots and wall.\n\nI have attached pictures of the interior, since there are absolutely NONE on the internet. So, we hope these pictures give you a good idea of the tent.\n\nWe love this tent so far, and are VERY excited to take it out!', ""This tent is AMAZING. We were staying at a campground in NC. It rained so hard all three nights, flash floods and everything! We woke to ankle deep water and even water running under the tent. Felt like we were on a water bed. But, we were dry! BONE DRY. Not a single leak. And it poured for about 5 hours each night! Also slept our family of 6 comfortably. I liked the divider for when someone needed to change. The zippers didn't get caught like other tents we have slept in. I would highly recommend this tent. Great price and my husband said it wasn't too hard to set up. You definitely need 2 people to set it up though. The tent itself is a little heavy but to be expected with that size."", 'First impressions, i love the tent. Shipping was fast, showed up 2 days before it said it would (so it got to my in 2 days instead of 4) since the poles are different sizes and colors, it made it easy to put together especially since i watched youtube reviews on it, i had a pretty good idea on how to put it up. My husband and i did it pretty fast.\nMy husband\'s first words about it ""this things huge!"" which is perfect for our growing family. It should fit our queen air bed, our toddlers sleeping pad, baby\'s pac n play, and our 2 80lb dogs and all our stuff nicely!\nPeople seemed concered about about the zipper and getting the rain flap stuck in it, as i always have, i use my hand to guide it out of the way as i zip it. Which proves to work great with tent as well.\nThe only issues i ran into while setting up was the separator in the tent, being a 7ft tall tent and me being 5ft2 ... I had to jump a couple times to get the zipper. And also putting the rain fly on, again being 5ft2 and the tent so tall, it took me a couple times to toss the fly over the tent to attach it. But not the tents fault for the lack of my height.\n\nHave not used it yet, will this weekend.\n\nUPDATE. Just used it for a 2 night camping trip. Convinced my husband not to put a tarp over thw rain fly, i wanted to see if it would leak. Unfortunately there was no rain to test it! The tent was way more roomy then i thought. It made our queen air matress look tiny. You could fit 4 of them in there lol. But it was perfect for us with our huge dogs, toddler and baby crib. Fast set up. I ended up taking it down myself while husband held our sleeping baby. Which was easy.\nIn the photots you can see the queen air matress, dog blankets, and our childs sleeping area on one side. And the crib on the other side.\n\nOnly thing is, Husband snapped the rope part of the sticks that go in to hold the awning part. So i emailed the company to get a new one.\n\nUPDATE. Called to get a replacment pole for the awning. And they sent the wrong one. So have to call again and hopefully will get the new one before we go camping. Nkt a huge deal though since its just the awning', 'We are a family of six, dad, mom, two teens (16&19), and two kids (7&9). We’ve only camped with mom and dad and the kids but the teens could easily camp with us with plenty of space in this tent.\n\nIt’s easy to set up, mom and kids can set this tent up in less than 20 minutes, and pack it up in about ten.\n\nIt has done great in rain with no issues of leaking.\n\nWe really like the space it provides for playing for the kids when the weather is yucky and you have to wait it out inside. (Which was one of our draws for purchasing a bigger tent).\n\nOur sleeping arrangements have included one set of disco bunks on one narrow wall and another set on the other and a chair next to one of the beds. Plenty off room for gear under the bunks or around the walls. We have also set it up with one cot on one narrow wall and one cot in the middle of the opposite “room” with a sleeping pad and bag on either side. And a chair next to the lone cot.\n\nWe have enjoyed the tent and plan to continue. The quality we have seen in it has been great.\n\nThe only downside is, it is heavy, but we knew that when we purchased it.', 'Ok, so first lets get the negatives out of the way as they are few; it should be obvious, but it is not an ultralight tent as it is massive, personally i\'d say feels like thirty five to forty pounds all in the carry bag. The steel uprights can hold a lot of sideways weight, but not so much on top, two of mine broke during a rather heavy flash snow fall/sleet. No interconnect sections to run power lines should you wish to run a side generator and lead power in.\n\nNow for the positives; this thing went through two years of flash floods, heavy rainfall and even collapsing under extreme snow and sleet, yet never once got wet inside. The fiberglass poles that support the shape of the canopy withstood three hundred to four hundred pounds of snow and ice over about twenty hours and show no signs of degradation. The small gear pockets are actually more useful in their positions than you would expect. Held up against huge gusts with no visible shaking or flexing. While super tall, I am 5\'6"" and set it up myself in about thirty five to forty five minutes, depending on how long since last time as I forget easily. When the uprights did break, I called the ALPS/Browning customer service at 1-800-344-2577 got connected to a nice representative in maybe less than a minute and had a new order of two poles placed and ready for ship in about ten minutes (this includes giving address card number etc.) which cost me about $24 usd and maybe $10 fast FEDEX shipping all the way out to middle of no where Iowa. I probably could have argued for free parts replacement, but the snowfall (while unexpected) does exceed the warranty of the three season tent and this was a few years after purchase anyway, but with how nice the representative was I bet I could have gotten it free if I tried. Overall, while not a perfect tent, this thing has held up the test of weather and time (excluding acts of nature flipping me the bird) and I have no regrets on the purchase at all.\n\nSide note: I would definitely say purchase the optional floor covering they offer as it really saves the floor of the tent since I don\'t take off my boots when going in and out. Another thing from experience is due to the color scheme, I was happy with the purchase of some glow in the dark guy-lines for finding it in the dark.', 'So after doing too much tent research I choose this one.\n\nMy only negative is the directions to put this tent together are pretty sad and trying to squeeze it back into the bag is very tight , But it was very simple to figure it out .\n\nThe tent set up quickly and I was amazed on how roomy it was .\n\nWe had high winds 30 mph gust and rain, the tent held up great and we stayed dry. The tent is high quality and I hope I can get many years out of it. I highly recommend it.', 'This tent was a very good choice. I checked reviews and researched and hit the jackpot.\nI have used this tent 7 times now and I ca tell you that it is made very well.\nI have not had it in rain yet but I have had it in very strong winds and it help up like a charm.\nThe tent has plenty of ventilation. My Husband is 6\' 3"" and has no problem standing and walking anywhere in this tent.\nIt\'s easy to put up and fits into the storage bag much easier than other I have owned.It has a zip up room divider if you are sharing the tent or need privacy while changing your clothes.', 'I give this tent a 5 star rating for several important reasons. It’s made of very sturdy material, zippers never snagged on me, it visually looks good, it kept all of the insects out, there was something to hang up a small light with, as you might see in the photo, and I had a great time with my family up in Joshua Tree. It was easy to put up and take down.\nIf you want an absolutely honest opinion, it’s not really as lightweight as you might think because the steel poles are heavy, but that’s a good thing. This tent will stand pretty still with some wind and not fly away. I wouldn’t recommend it for long rugged hikes. It’s great for pulling out of your truck and over to your campsite. Another thing is, it’s very spacious and high, which I love, but if you plan on using air mattresses or cots, then consider this more of a 4 man tent. 5 would work for sleeping on the ground.\nCan’t wait to use this again!', ""We just got back from a week of camping in the Poconos with this tent. We are a family of 4 and had plenty of room to move around. We set the tent up in just a few minutes. No issues at all. Took the tent down in the same amount of time. Tall people will have no issue standing in this tent. There are 6 pouches inside to store small items. The center has a small loop to attach a light. The room divider just zips right down the middle. I wouldn't use this tent in the winter since the rain fly is raised off of the mesh roof a little so cold air can get in. In the one picture I added, I was standing on the outside looking in the window to take the picture. That is a queen size air bed and two twin air beds. Exactly what we were looking for."", 'This has to be the best tent we have used ! This tent is 10 x 15 with a very high ceiling height, we wanted a tent we could stand up completely inside and this one fits that bill. The top corners of the tent are reinforced, it comes with heavy duty poles and the bath tub floor comes up higher than other tents we have had in the past. We noticed small holes in one top corner of the tent, emailed customer service, and got a reply back within 15 minutes with Fed Ex tracking information, they sent us a new tent skin to replace the one with the holes and it arrived in just a couple days. The customer service for this tent is top notch. I liked it having the option to use the room divider or tie it back. We had no problem setting this tent up, took us about 15 minutes.']","[['The text is too big to be classified'], [['POSITIVE', 0.7784997224807739]], ['The text is too big to be classified'], [['POSITIVE', 0.9799591302871704]], [['NEGATIVE', 0.9547913670539856]], [['POSITIVE', 0.9966541528701782]], [['POSITIVE', 0.999637246131897]], [['POSITIVE', 0.9981181621551514]], [['NEGATIVE', 0.9878972768783569]], [['POSITIVE', 0.7727257013320923]]]"
